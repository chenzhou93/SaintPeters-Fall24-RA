On November. 5, 2024 US voters will cast their votes for the next president.



**U.S. Elections are around the corner, and in exactly 36 days, the fate of America will be decided. Stay informed by reading facts and narratives.**



US Election 2024The US presidential election will be held on Nov. 5, 2024. The candidates are Donald Trump (Republican), Kamala Harris (Democratic), Jill Stein (Green Party), Chase Oliver (Libertarian), and Cornel West (independent). Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (independent) suspended his campaign in August, though he will remain on the ballot in some states.  
  
Here's our latest controversy: [https://www.verity.news/controversies/us-election-2024](https://www.verity.news/controversies/us-election-2024)



What do you think?  
  
ECONOMY: Trump pledges US energy independence, spending cuts, and reduced regulations to curb inflation while reinstating tax cuts. Harris pledges to cut taxes for working-class families, make the ‚Äúultra-wealthy‚Äù pay more, cut the deficit by $3T, and fund housing, supply chains, and childcare.\[1\]\[2\]\[3\]



IMMIGRATION: Trump pledges to finish the border wall, strengthen ICE, and launch the largest deportation program in American history, while Harris advocates for expanding legal immigration and creating a pathway to citizenship for unauthorized migrants.



ABORTION: Trump thinks abortion laws should be left to the states, opposes late-term abortions, and backs prenatal care. Harris pledges to restore Roe v. Wade, repeal the Hyde Amendment, and ensure access to medication abortion. Both back IVF.



CRIME: Harris pledges to end private prisons, abolish solitary confinement and chokeholds, and provide support for convicts reentering society, while Trump promises to robustly support police departments, back qualified immunity, and impose the death penalty on child traffickers and rapists.



FOREIGN POLICY: Harris pledges unwavering support for Ukraine for as long as it takes to attain a ‚Äújust and lasting‚Äù peace, alongside backing a negotiated two-state solution in the Middle East. Trump promises to ensure collective defense contributions, support Israel, and promptly end the Ukraine conflict.

180,1fsu05s,I flicked off Kamala Harris today.üòÖ,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fsu05s,"I don‚Äôt know whether to continue to laugh for the rest of my life considering almost no one will ever get to say ‚Äúyeah. I flicked off the first ever female presidential candidate in the US‚Ä¶but she‚Äôs honestly kinda evil so whatever‚Äù and feel justified because of the destruction she causes, or feel like shit because that action stoops just as low as the democrats. 

I don‚Äôt know whether to feel embarrassed or very accomplished. It‚Äôs something that so many people want to do, but in the moment wouldn‚Äôt. I almost put my hand down. In a small moment of anger towards her and her policies I impulsively just kept my middle finger up‚Ä¶

I live near LAX and she was headed to the airport to board Airforce 2. As we reached the very end of Pershing drive going southbound and were stopped at the very end light, Kamala‚Äôs entire motorcade turned the corner and began a to drive past us northbound. Our lane, far left lane, was the closest one to them. Her car drove right past us. The windows were not really super tinted. We saw her, and as she turned the corner she could see everyone in their cars. Everyone could see each other. It‚Äôs not hard to. We could all see her in the backseat.m

For about 2-3 brief seconds, as her car got closer and approached its parallel point to us, she looked at me, and then put her head down. To keep the quality of the footage my middle finger is not in the video, but it was there behind the camera. The camera doesn‚Äôt do justice to what my husband and I actually saw in that car. 

Either way 2 hours later we just went home and I jammed to music so casually as if I did not just hand signal fuck you to the vice president of the United States and the first ever female VP. Lawwwdddd.

Yes he is a moderate. During presidential debates, everyone was arguing what week abortion should be banned. Trump came in and axed it. Gay marriage debate got axed by Trump as well. He is a moderate, despite ""far right"" being thrown all over the place.

2016 dark horse was the rust belt. 2020 was the minority demographic, thanks to the stupid cop not chilling out on camera and not minding the sensitivity of white on black. Especially when lies spread super quickly without any fact checking. 2020 doesn't apply anymore after Trump got a lot more minority support and racial tensions eased. Not surprised, most social conservative in the US are minorities and not white people. I know some folks who would disown their son for being gay but still for democrat. Catholics didn't seem so likable with what Biden did with abortion. I never remember Democrats pushing left values this far in 2020 before. It leaves a sour taste like mustard mixed with water.

I think the main dark horse this time is the economy and immigration. Desantis and Aboott are Trump's biggest recruiters on the social side, and people are sick of the expensive everything with Biden being Maga's biggest supporter by failing so bad under Kamala secretly running the show and voting in pretty bad tie breaking votes herself.
