[Source: Associated Press](<https://apnews.com/article/trump-indicted-jan-6-investigation-special-counsel-debb59bb7a4d9f93f7e2dace01feccdc>). The charges include: Conspiracy to Defraud the United States, Conspiracy to Obstruct an Official Proceeding, Obstruction of and Attempt to Obstruct an Official Proceeding, and Conspiracy Against Rights. [You can read the full indictment for yourself here at CourtListener.](<https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149.1.0_1.pdf>) These charges stem from one of two separate investigations into Trump being conducted by Special Counsel Jack Smith for the US Department of Justice. The first investigation is into the apparent mishandling of highly classified documents after Trump had departed office. This resulted in [37 felony charges](<https://www.npr.org/2023/06/09/1181340894/trump-indictment-classified-documents-charges>) being made public on June 9th of this year, with [3 additional, related charges](<https://www.npr.org/2023/07/29/1190953438/trump-faces-new-charges-in-classified-documents-case>) added last week. Today's charges stem from the second investigation headed by Smith, which is into the January 6th, 2021 attack on the US Capitol and associated efforts within the Trump Administration to illegally overturn Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election. The aforementioned investigations into Trump are a separate matter from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's inquiry, which in April resulted in an indictment on [34 counts of falsification of business records](<https://www.npr.org/2023/04/04/1167708172/trump-charges-hush-money-new-york-indictment>). According to Bragg, Trump was part of a scheme to catch and kill"" negative information about himself before and after the 2016 election via hush money payments made via the Trump Organization.  Still outstanding are the results of a fourth probe being conducted by Fani Willis, the District Attorney for Fulton County, Georgia.  That probe is into Trump and others' efforts to overturn Georgia's 2020 presidential election results; an announcement related to DA Willis' probe is [expected sometime later in August](https://apnews.com/article/trump-georgia-election-investigation-fani-willis-d6191037a8993d653686e679bf5e8ea5).

[Source: Associated Press](<https://apnews.com/article/trump-indicted-jan-6-investigation-special-counsel-debb59bb7a4d9f93f7e2dace01feccdc>). The charges include: Conspiracy to Defraud the United States, Conspiracy to Obstruct an Official Proceeding, Obstruction of and Attempt to Obstruct an Official Proceeding, and Conspiracy Against Rights. [You can read the full indictment for yourself here at CourtListener.](<https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149.1.0_1.pdf>) These charges stem from one of two separate investigations into Trump being conducted by Special Counsel Jack Smith for the US Department of Justice. The first investigation is into the apparent mishandling of highly classified documents after Trump had departed office. This resulted in [37 felony charges](<https://www.npr.org/2023/06/09/1181340894/trump-indictment-classified-documents-charges>) being made public on June 9th of this year, with [3 additional, related charges](<https://www.npr.org/2023/07/29/1190953438/trump-faces-new-charges-in-classified-documents-case>) added last week. Today's charges stem from the second investigation headed by Smith, which is into the January 6th, 2021 attack on the US Capitol and associated efforts within the Trump Administration to illegally overturn Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election. The aforementioned investigations into Trump are a separate matter from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's inquiry, which in April resulted in an indictment on [34 counts of falsification of business records](<https://www.npr.org/2023/04/04/1167708172/trump-charges-hush-money-new-york-indictment>). According to Bragg, Trump was part of a scheme to catch and kill"" negative information about himself before and after the 2016 election via hush money payments made via the Trump Organization.  Still outstanding are the results of a fourth probe being conducted by Fani Willis, the District Attorney for Fulton County, Georgia.  That probe is into Trump and others' efforts to overturn Georgia's 2020 presidential election results; an announcement related to DA Willis' probe is [expected sometime later in August](https://apnews.com/article/trump-georgia-election-investigation-fani-willis-d6191037a8993d653686e679bf5e8ea5).

The opinion is a “per curiam,” meaning it is behalf of the entire court and not signed by any particular justice. However, the three liberal justices — Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson — filed their own joint opinion concurring in the judgment.

1al6iir,"We brought the 14th Amendment lawsuit that barred Trump from the CO ballot. Tomorrow, we defend that victory before the Supreme Court. Ask Us Anything.",https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1al6iir/we_brought_the_14th_amendment_lawsuit_that_barred/,"Hi there - we’re Noah Bookbinder (President), Donald Sherman (Chief Counsel) and Nikhel Sus (Director of Strategic Litigation) with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a non-partisan ethics watchdog organization based in DC. Tomorrow, we will be at the Supreme Court as part of the legal team representing the voters challenging Trump's eligibility to be on the presidential primary ballot in the case Trump v. Anderson, et al. Here’s the proof: https://twitter.com/CREWcrew/status/1754958181174763641.

Donald Trump’s actions on January 6, 2021 bar him from presidential primary ballots under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. Section 3 bars anyone from holding office if they swore an “oath . . . to support the Constitution of the United States” as a federal or state officer and then “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” against the Constitution. It was written to ensure that anyone who engages in insurrectionist activity is not eligible to join – or lead – the very government they attempted to overthrow. Trump does not need to be found guilty of an insurrection to be disqualified from holding office. 

We believe that disqualifying Trump as a presidential candidate is a matter not of partisan politics, but of Constitutional obligation. Rule of law and faith in the judicial system must be protected, and in defending the decision of the Colorado Supreme Court, we are working to defend American democracy. 

Ask us anything!

Ask Us Anything.",https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1al6iir/we_brought_the_14th_amendment_lawsuit_that_barred/,"Hi there - we’re Noah Bookbinder (President), Donald Sherman (Chief Counsel) and Nikhel Sus (Director of Strategic Litigation) with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a non-partisan ethics watchdog organization based in DC. Tomorrow, we will be at the Supreme Court as part of the legal team representing the voters challenging Trump's eligibility to be on the presidential primary ballot in the case Trump v. Anderson, et al. Here’s the proof: https://twitter.com/CREWcrew/status/1754958181174763641.

Donald Trump’s actions on January 6, 2021 bar him from presidential primary ballots under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. Section 3 bars anyone from holding office if they swore an “oath . . . to support the Constitution of the United States” as a federal or state officer and then “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” against the Constitution. It was written to ensure that anyone who engages in insurrectionist activity is not eligible to join – or lead – the very government they attempted to overthrow. Trump does not need to be found guilty of an insurrection to be disqualified from holding office. 

We believe that disqualifying Trump as a presidential candidate is a matter not of partisan politics, but of Constitutional obligation. Rule of law and faith in the judicial system must be protected, and in defending the decision of the Colorado Supreme Court, we are working to defend American democracy. 

Ask us anything!

176lukt,Megathread: Steve Scalise Withdraws from Race for Speaker of the US House,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/176lukt/megathread_steve_scalise_withdraws_from_race_for/,"US Representative Steve Scalise (R-Louisiana) has withdrawn his candidacy to be Speaker of the House of Representatives due to his inability to muster the necessary support to win a full floor vote. He was nominated by the House Republican Caucus to be the Republicans’ choice for Speaker over Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) earlier this week in a secret vote of 113 to 99. Withholding their votes from Scalise is a faction of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, [per the Associated Press](<https://apnews.com/article/kevin-mccarthy-ousted-speaker-jordan-scalise-1492ca6b58604c51186015c23f7efccd|https://apnews.com/article/kevin-mccarthy-ousted-speaker-jordan-scalise-1492ca6b58604c51186015c23f7efccd>). Scalise has said he will stay on as House Majority Leader. It is unclear who the GOP will next nominate as their candidate for Speaker. Without a Speaker, the House is unable to conduct virtually any business.

There's a lot of disinformation worming its way around online, and we are doing our best to fight it here in /r/news. Below you'll find a lot of important information to help you navigate voting and watching the results come in.

&nbsp;

## Your Voting Rights on Election Day

1. The FBI [is warning](https://twitter.com/FBI/status/1589241399039463424) that people may try to scam you or lie to you about the date of the election or your polling place. **Today, Tuesday, November 8 is Election Day.** You can look up your polling place [here.](https://www.vote.org/polling-place-locator/)

2. Many states require some form of identification to vote in person. And the laws in your state may have changed in recent years. Make sure to [check your local election rules](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx#Laws%20in%20Effect) so you know what identification may be required.

3. If the polls close while you are waiting in line to vote, REMAIN IN LINE. The polling location must let you vote if you were already in line before the polls closed. 

4. If you voted by mail, you can [track your ballot here.](https://www.cnet.com/news/politics/how-do-i-track-my-ballot-details-for-every-state/) 

5. You have the right to vote in private and without being intimidated. If you experience voter intimidation, let a poll worker know and then report it to the Election Protection Hotline (1-866-OUR-VOTE) or the US Department of Justice voting rights hotline (1-800-253-3931). You should also contact your state board of elections. 

Not sure what voter intimidation is? [The ACLU has a good explainer here.](https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_pdf_file/kyr-voterintimidation-v03.pdf)


&nbsp;

##Here's a quick FAQ to help you understand the 2022 midterm elections in the United States:


* **When will we get results?**

> Experts are predicting that it could take a few days to get the final unofficial vote tallies in some states. [FiveThirtyEight has a good breakdown here.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/when-election-results-2022/) 

> The biggest reason for the expected delay in results this year is due to mail-in ballots - including ballots from military service members - which some states are not allowed to start counting until the polls close. For example, Pennsylvania does not start processing their mail-in ballots until Election Day, even if they've received them in advance. 

> In especially close races, the delays could be longer because it could come down to just a handful of votes. 

&nbsp;

* **But all the ballots should be counted on election night!**

> FALSE. On election night, experts make projections based on statistical probabilities with the data they have. It is normal for it to take weeks to count all the votes. The good news is that most states are optimistic that they can have the unofficial vote count available within the first 72 hours. 

&nbsp;

* **Okay - but counting votes after election night will steal the election!**

> FALSE. Mail in ballots have to be postmarked by Election Day, and many states require that they must be received by Election Day. States have to count all votes. Counting all the votes cast isn't ""stealing"" anything: it's making sure that every vote is counted, just like every other election.

&nbsp;

* **What's this ""red mirage"" I keep hearing about?**

> A ""red mirage"" is expected in some states where election day votes are counted first. This is because election day voters tend to skew Republican, while early voting and mail-in-ballots tend to skew Democrat. This means that a state, like Pennsylvania, will count those Election Day votes first, which will make it appear like the Republican candidates have a massive lead. 

> However, as election workers start counting those mail-in-ballots, the Democratic candidates will start gaining ground. This is expected. It's not fraud. It's just the votes being counted. 

&nbsp;

* **What about the ""blue mirage""? I've also heard that phrase floating around.**

> Unlike Pennsylvania, Arizona begins counting votes as they are received. This means that early votes and mail-in-ballots will already be in the process of being counted on Election Day, and when polls close, it will look like the Democratic candidates have a lead. 

> As the night goes on, you should expect to see Republicans make up ground and you'll see a ""red shift"".  

> This is why counting all the votes is not a partisan endeavor. 

&nbsp;

* **Okay, so which states will have a ""red mirage"" or a ""blue mirage""?**

CNN has done a good job of [laying all this out](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/07/politics/blue-shift-red-mirage-2022-election-results/index.html) and explaining the mirages and shifts we might see this year. But here's a cheat sheet for you:

> **Pennsylvania**: Likely red to blue

> **Arizona**: Likely blue to red

> **Georgia**: Likely red to blue

> **Nevada**: Unclear

> **Wisconsin**: Likely red to blue

> **Michigan**: Likely red to blue

&nbsp;

* **Are mail-in ballots rife with fraud?**

> No. Mail-in ballots are very secure and they are legal votes. Those ballots must be cast and post-marked by Election Day. We have been using mail-in ballots [since the Civil War](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/debate-over-mail-voting-dates-back-civil-war-180976091/), and in 2016, 25% of votes were cast by mail. In 2020, it rose to 46%, largely due to the pandemic. [Here's a handy chart showing how votes have been cast since 1992.](https://imgur.com/QFk3T6L)

> Colorado is almost completely vote by mail and has some of the [most secure elections](https://www.rmpbs.org/blogs/news/experts-colorados-elections-system-is-the-gold-standard-nationally/) in the country. Check out this helpful vote by mail resource from the [Brennan Center](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/false-narrative-vote-mail-fraud). Heck, Ivanka and Jared even [voted by mail](https://twitter.com/IvankaTrump/status/1320775685514772480) in the 2020 election.

&nbsp;

* **Are Democrats/Republicans/Aliens/Bigfoot trying to steal the election?**

> No. Counting the votes is not stealing the election. Americans cast their votes and now we must wait for them all to be counted. 

&nbsp; 

* **Where can I find the official election results?**

> The only official results are those certified by state elections officials. While the media can make projections based on ballots counted versus outstanding, state election officials are the authorities. So if you’re not sure about a victory claim you’re seeing in the media or from candidates, check back with the local officials. The National Association of Secretaries of States lets you look up state election officials [here.](https://www.nass.org/initiatives/trustedinfo)


&nbsp;

##Help us stop disinformation

We have a zero-tolerance policy for election disinformation. 

Please report comments that:

* Claim that mail-in ballots are fraudulent.

* Claim that the election is being stolen.

* Claim that a candidate has won an election before the results have been officially called.

* Call for violence or try to organize for violent action.

##Here's a quick FAQ to help you understand the 2022 midterm elections in the United States:


* **When will we get results?**

> Experts are predicting that it could take a few days to get the final unofficial vote tallies in some states. [FiveThirtyEight has a good breakdown here.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/when-election-results-2022/) 

> The biggest reason for the expected delay in results this year is due to mail-in ballots - including ballots from military service members - which some states are not allowed to start counting until the polls close. For example, Pennsylvania does not start processing their mail-in ballots until Election Day, even if they've received them in advance. 

> In especially close races, the delays could be longer because it could come down to just a handful of votes. 

&nbsp;

* **But all the ballots should be counted on election night!**

> FALSE. On election night, experts make projections based on statistical probabilities with the data they have. It is normal for it to take weeks to count all the votes. The good news is that most states are optimistic that they can have the unofficial vote count available within the first 72 hours. 

&nbsp;

* **Okay - but counting votes after election night will steal the election!**

> FALSE. Mail in ballots have to be postmarked by Election Day, and many states require that they must be received by Election Day. States have to count all votes. Counting all the votes cast isn't ""stealing"" anything: it's making sure that every vote is counted, just like every other election.

&nbsp;

* **What's this ""red mirage"" I keep hearing about?**

> A ""red mirage"" is expected in some states where election day votes are counted first. This is because election day voters tend to skew Republican, while early voting and mail-in-ballots tend to skew Democrat. This means that a state, like Pennsylvania, will count those Election Day votes first, which will make it appear like the Republican candidates have a massive lead. 

> However, as election workers start counting those mail-in-ballots, the Democratic candidates will start gaining ground. This is expected. It's not fraud. It's just the votes being counted. 

&nbsp;

* **What about the ""blue mirage""? I've also heard that phrase floating around.**

> Unlike Pennsylvania, Arizona begins counting votes as they are received. This means that early votes and mail-in-ballots will already be in the process of being counted on Election Day, and when polls close, it will look like the Democratic candidates have a lead. 

> As the night goes on, you should expect to see Republicans make up ground and you'll see a ""red shift"".  

> This is why counting all the votes is not a partisan endeavor. 

&nbsp;

* **Okay, so which states will have a ""red mirage"" or a ""blue mirage""?**

CNN has done a good job of [laying all this out](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/07/politics/blue-shift-red-mirage-2022-election-results/index.html) and explaining the mirages and shifts we might see this year. But here's a cheat sheet for you:

> **Pennsylvania**: Likely red to blue

> **Arizona**: Likely blue to red

> **Georgia**: Likely red to blue

> **Nevada**: Unclear

> **Wisconsin**: Likely red to blue

> **Michigan**: Likely red to blue

&nbsp;

* **Are mail-in ballots rife with fraud?**

> No. Mail-in ballots are very secure and they are legal votes. Those ballots must be cast and post-marked by Election Day. We have been using mail-in ballots [since the Civil War](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/debate-over-mail-voting-dates-back-civil-war-180976091/), and in 2016, 25% of votes were cast by mail. In 2020, it rose to 46%, largely due to the pandemic. [Here's a handy chart showing how votes have been cast since 1992.](https://imgur.com/QFk3T6L)

> Colorado is almost completely vote by mail and has some of the [most secure elections](https://www.rmpbs.org/blogs/news/experts-colorados-elections-system-is-the-gold-standard-nationally/) in the country. Check out this helpful vote by mail resource from the [Brennan Center](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/false-narrative-vote-mail-fraud). Heck, Ivanka and Jared even [voted by mail](https://twitter.com/IvankaTrump/status/1320775685514772480) in the 2020 election.

&nbsp;

* **Are Democrats/Republicans/Aliens/Bigfoot trying to steal the election?**

> No. Counting the votes is not stealing the election. Americans cast their votes and now we must wait for them all to be counted. 

&nbsp; 

* **Where can I find the official election results?**

> The only official results are those certified by state elections officials. While the media can make projections based on ballots counted versus outstanding, state election officials are the authorities. So if you’re not sure about a victory claim you’re seeing in the media or from candidates, check back with the local officials. The National Association of Secretaries of States lets you look up state election officials [here.](https://www.nass.org/initiatives/trustedinfo)

> Experts are predicting that it could take a few days to get the final unofficial vote tallies in some states. [FiveThirtyEight has a good breakdown here.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/when-election-results-2022/) 

> The biggest reason for the expected delay in results this year is due to mail-in ballots - including ballots from military service members - which some states are not allowed to start counting until the polls close. For example, Pennsylvania does not start processing their mail-in ballots until Election Day, even if they've received them in advance.

The good news is that most states are optimistic that they can have the unofficial vote count available within the first 72 hours. 

&nbsp;

CNN has done a good job of [laying all this out](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/07/politics/blue-shift-red-mirage-2022-election-results/index.html) and explaining the mirages and shifts we might see this year. But here's a cheat sheet for you:

> **Georgia**: Likely red to blue

> **Wisconsin**: Likely red to blue

&nbsp;

* **Are mail-in ballots rife with fraud?**

> No. Mail-in ballots are very secure and they are legal votes. Those ballots must be cast and post-marked by Election Day. We have been using mail-in ballots [since the Civil War](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/debate-over-mail-voting-dates-back-civil-war-180976091/), and in 2016, 25% of votes were cast by mail. In 2020, it rose to 46%, largely due to the pandemic. [Here's a handy chart showing how votes have been cast since 1992.](https://imgur.com/QFk3T6L)

&nbsp;

* **Are Democrats/Republicans/Aliens/Bigfoot trying to steal the election?**

> No. Counting the votes is not stealing the election. Americans cast their votes and now we must wait for them all to be counted. 

&nbsp; 

* **Where can I find the official election results?**

> The only official results are those certified by state elections officials. While the media can make projections based on ballots counted versus outstanding, state election officials are the authorities.

Below you'll find a lot of important information to help you navigate voting and watching the results come in.

&nbsp;

## Your Voting Rights on Election Day

1. The FBI [is warning](https://twitter.com/FBI/status/1589241399039463424) that people may try to scam you or lie to you about the date of the election or your polling place. **Today, Tuesday, November 8 is Election Day.** You can look up your polling place [here.](https://www.vote.org/polling-place-locator/)

2. Many states require some form of identification to vote in person. And the laws in your state may have changed in recent years. Make sure to [check your local election rules](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx#Laws%20in%20Effect) so you know what identification may be required.

3. If the polls close while you are waiting in line to vote, REMAIN IN LINE. The polling location must let you vote if you were already in line before the polls closed. 

4. If you voted by mail, you can [track your ballot here.](https://www.cnet.com/news/politics/how-do-i-track-my-ballot-details-for-every-state/) 

5. You have the right to vote in private and without being intimidated. If you experience voter intimidation, let a poll worker know and then report it to the Election Protection Hotline (1-866-OUR-VOTE) or the US Department of Justice voting rights hotline (1-800-253-3931). You should also contact your state board of elections. 

Not sure what voter intimidation is? [The ACLU has a good explainer here.](https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_pdf_file/kyr-voterintimidation-v03.pdf)


&nbsp;

##Here's a quick FAQ to help you understand the 2022 midterm elections in the United States:


* **When will we get results?**

> Experts are predicting that it could take a few days to get the final unofficial vote tallies in some states. [FiveThirtyEight has a good breakdown here.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/when-election-results-2022/) 

> The biggest reason for the expected delay in results this year is due to mail-in ballots - including ballots from military service members - which some states are not allowed to start counting until the polls close. For example, Pennsylvania does not start processing their mail-in ballots until Election Day, even if they've received them in advance. 

> In especially close races, the delays could be longer because it could come down to just a handful of votes. 

&nbsp;

* **But all the ballots should be counted on election night!**

> FALSE. On election night, experts make projections based on statistical probabilities with the data they have. It is normal for it to take weeks to count all the votes. The good news is that most states are optimistic that they can have the unofficial vote count available within the first 72 hours. 

&nbsp;

* **Okay - but counting votes after election night will steal the election!**

> FALSE. Mail in ballots have to be postmarked by Election Day, and many states require that they must be received by Election Day. States have to count all votes. Counting all the votes cast isn't ""stealing"" anything: it's making sure that every vote is counted, just like every other election.

&nbsp;

* **What's this ""red mirage"" I keep hearing about?**

> A ""red mirage"" is expected in some states where election day votes are counted first. This is because election day voters tend to skew Republican, while early voting and mail-in-ballots tend to skew Democrat. This means that a state, like Pennsylvania, will count those Election Day votes first, which will make it appear like the Republican candidates have a massive lead. 

> However, as election workers start counting those mail-in-ballots, the Democratic candidates will start gaining ground. This is expected. It's not fraud. It's just the votes being counted. 

&nbsp;

* **What about the ""blue mirage""? I've also heard that phrase floating around.**

> Unlike Pennsylvania, Arizona begins counting votes as they are received. This means that early votes and mail-in-ballots will already be in the process of being counted on Election Day, and when polls close, it will look like the Democratic candidates have a lead. 

> As the night goes on, you should expect to see Republicans make up ground and you'll see a ""red shift"".  

> This is why counting all the votes is not a partisan endeavor. 

&nbsp;

* **Okay, so which states will have a ""red mirage"" or a ""blue mirage""?**

CNN has done a good job of [laying all this out](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/07/politics/blue-shift-red-mirage-2022-election-results/index.html) and explaining the mirages and shifts we might see this year. But here's a cheat sheet for you:

> **Georgia**: Likely red to blue

> **Nevada**: Unclear

There's a lot of disinformation worming its way around online, and we are doing our best to fight it here in /r/news. Below you'll find a lot of important information to help you navigate voting and watching the results come in.

&nbsp;

## Your Voting Rights on Election Day

1. The FBI [is warning](https://twitter.com/FBI/status/1589241399039463424) that people may try to scam you or lie to you about the date of the election or your polling place. **Today, Tuesday, November 8 is Election Day.** You can look up your polling place [here.](https://www.vote.org/polling-place-locator/)

2. Many states require some form of identification to vote in person. And the laws in your state may have changed in recent years. Make sure to [check your local election rules](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx#Laws%20in%20Effect) so you know what identification may be required.

3. If the polls close while you are waiting in line to vote, REMAIN IN LINE. The polling location must let you vote if you were already in line before the polls closed. 

4. If you voted by mail, you can [track your ballot here.](https://www.cnet.com/news/politics/how-do-i-track-my-ballot-details-for-every-state/) 

5. You have the right to vote in private and without being intimidated. If you experience voter intimidation, let a poll worker know and then report it to the Election Protection Hotline (1-866-OUR-VOTE) or the US Department of Justice voting rights hotline (1-800-253-3931). You should also contact your state board of elections. 

Not sure what voter intimidation is? [The ACLU has a good explainer here.](https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_pdf_file/kyr-voterintimidation-v03.pdf)


&nbsp;

##Here's a quick FAQ to help you understand the 2022 midterm elections in the United States:


* **When will we get results?**

> Experts are predicting that it could take a few days to get the final unofficial vote tallies in some states. [FiveThirtyEight has a good breakdown here.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/when-election-results-2022/) 

> The biggest reason for the expected delay in results this year is due to mail-in ballots - including ballots from military service members - which some states are not allowed to start counting until the polls close. For example, Pennsylvania does not start processing their mail-in ballots until Election Day, even if they've received them in advance. 

> In especially close races, the delays could be longer because it could come down to just a handful of votes. 

&nbsp;

* **But all the ballots should be counted on election night!**

> FALSE. On election night, experts make projections based on statistical probabilities with the data they have. It is normal for it to take weeks to count all the votes. The good news is that most states are optimistic that they can have the unofficial vote count available within the first 72 hours. 

&nbsp;

* **Okay - but counting votes after election night will steal the election!**

> FALSE. Mail in ballots have to be postmarked by Election Day, and many states require that they must be received by Election Day. States have to count all votes. Counting all the votes cast isn't ""stealing"" anything: it's making sure that every vote is counted, just like every other election.

&nbsp;

* **What's this ""red mirage"" I keep hearing about?**

> A ""red mirage"" is expected in some states where election day votes are counted first. This is because election day voters tend to skew Republican, while early voting and mail-in-ballots tend to skew Democrat. This means that a state, like Pennsylvania, will count those Election Day votes first, which will make it appear like the Republican candidates have a massive lead. 

> However, as election workers start counting those mail-in-ballots, the Democratic candidates will start gaining ground. This is expected. It's not fraud. It's just the votes being counted. 

&nbsp;

* **What about the ""blue mirage""? I've also heard that phrase floating around.**

> Unlike Pennsylvania, Arizona begins counting votes as they are received. This means that early votes and mail-in-ballots will already be in the process of being counted on Election Day, and when polls close, it will look like the Democratic candidates have a lead. 

> As the night goes on, you should expect to see Republicans make up ground and you'll see a ""red shift"".  

> This is why counting all the votes is not a partisan endeavor. 

&nbsp;

* **Okay, so which states will have a ""red mirage"" or a ""blue mirage""?**

CNN has done a good job of [laying all this out](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/07/politics/blue-shift-red-mirage-2022-election-results/index.html) and explaining the mirages and shifts we might see this year. But here's a cheat sheet for you:

> **Pennsylvania**: Likely red to blue

> **Arizona**: Likely blue to red

> **Georgia**: Likely red to blue

> **Nevada**: Unclear

> **Wisconsin**: Likely red to blue

> **Michigan**: Likely red to blue

&nbsp;

* **Are mail-in ballots rife with fraud?**

> No. Mail-in ballots are very secure and they are legal votes. Those ballots must be cast and post-marked by Election Day. We have been using mail-in ballots [since the Civil War](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/debate-over-mail-voting-dates-back-civil-war-180976091/), and in 2016, 25% of votes were cast by mail. In 2020, it rose to 46%, largely due to the pandemic. [Here's a handy chart showing how votes have been cast since 1992.](https://imgur.com/QFk3T6L)

> Colorado is almost completely vote by mail and has some of the [most secure elections](https://www.rmpbs.org/blogs/news/experts-colorados-elections-system-is-the-gold-standard-nationally/) in the country. Check out this helpful vote by mail resource from the [Brennan Center](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/false-narrative-vote-mail-fraud). Heck, Ivanka and Jared even [voted by mail](https://twitter.com/IvankaTrump/status/1320775685514772480) in the 2020 election.

&nbsp;

* **Are Democrats/Republicans/Aliens/Bigfoot trying to steal the election?**

> No. Counting the votes is not stealing the election. Americans cast their votes and now we must wait for them all to be counted. 

&nbsp; 

* **Where can I find the official election results?**

> The only official results are those certified by state elections officials. While the media can make projections based on ballots counted versus outstanding, state election officials are the authorities. So if you’re not sure about a victory claim you’re seeing in the media or from candidates, check back with the local officials. The National Association of Secretaries of States lets you look up state election officials [here.](https://www.nass.org/initiatives/trustedinfo)


&nbsp;

##Help us stop disinformation

Today is the first day of the presidential election in Russia, and I’m here to talk all things elections. AMA!",https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1bfgorp/im_andrey_pertsev_a_russian_journalist_with/,"We will be starting the AMA at 12:00 EDT  
Hey everyone! My name is Andrey Pertsev and I’m a Russian journalist with Meduza. My work also appears in Carnegie Russia and Riddle. I’m best known for having sources throughout the Russian government, and understanding the political machinations of the Russian Federation. I’m from Arkhangelsk, but I’ve been to a majority of Russia’s regions and know their political structures well.

  
Starting today, some Russians will head to the polls for yet another presidential vote. Others, such as in Russian-occupied Ukraine, will have the polls come to them. And while the outcome is not really in doubt — incumbent Vladimir Putin is expected to win by a record landslide — there’s still much to talk about when it comes to the Kremlin’s machinations, possible protests, the other Kremlin-approved candidates, and the candidates the Kremlin did not approve of.

yritu4,McCarthy and McConnell Must Go,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/yritu4/mccarthy_and_mcconnell_must_go/,"*This isn't being said enough*. Blame Trump all you want, but he wasn't on the ballot. This was the Republicans' race to lose, and the party leadership bears the blame. McCarthy tries to present himself as a populist but most view him with distrust as they should. We shouldn't be questioning if we will even win the House, that was supposed to be a forgone conclusion. But if we win it, McCarthy *should not* be rewarded for this disastrous underperformance. Beneath him, Tom Emmer is the chair of the NRCC; he's the guy in charge of the cash. The NRCC directed millions into D+20 districts from California to Michigan, rather than the tossups that Republicans should have been guaranteed to pick up. This alone was pure incompetence at best and sabotage at worst.

McConnell on the other hand is clearly an establishment crony with preference for loyalty and backdoor deals with Democrats than supporting America First candidates. We need to remember that its McConnell who poured millions of dollars into Colorado and Alaska, one being a race where the Republicans *never* could've won, and the other to save Lisa Murkoswki whose *own state party* has censured her.  Murkowski votes for Biden 67% of the time, and no matter what happens in Alaska, a Republican will still win it; there's no reason to dump money over there. Furthermor, McConnell refused to support Masters in Arizona, he refused to support Bolduc in New Hampshire, and he left Walker out to dry. Once these guys announced they wouldn't support McConnell for Senate Majority Leader, McConnell pulled out the cash. **He'd rather stay in power as a minority leader than have the majority for the American people**. This was the ultimate dereliction of leadership.

I'm not saying Trump is or isn't partly responsible for what happened this midterm. But McCarthy and McConnell are our coaches, and we just fumbled *hard.* When you're the coach of a team and you fail to win when everything is pointing to victory, that coach gets fired. Say what you want about candidate quality or messaging, but **we need to clean house; McCarthy and McConnell need to go**.",2517,780,SupremeChancellor66,Conservative,1668095072.0,0.76,/r/Conservative/comments/yritu4/mccarthy_and_mcconnell_must_go/,False

It’s almost as if no one cares about these debates.  Which I can understand, I mean who cares who comes in second place and wins the RINO vote?

yritu4,McCarthy and McConnell Must Go,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/yritu4/mccarthy_and_mcconnell_must_go/,"*This isn't being said enough*. Blame Trump all you want, but he wasn't on the ballot. This was the Republicans' race to lose, and the party leadership bears the blame. McCarthy tries to present himself as a populist but most view him with distrust as they should. We shouldn't be questioning if we will even win the House, that was supposed to be a forgone conclusion. But if we win it, McCarthy *should not* be rewarded for this disastrous underperformance. Beneath him, Tom Emmer is the chair of the NRCC; he's the guy in charge of the cash. The NRCC directed millions into D+20 districts from California to Michigan, rather than the tossups that Republicans should have been guaranteed to pick up. This alone was pure incompetence at best and sabotage at worst.

McConnell on the other hand is clearly an establishment crony with preference for loyalty and backdoor deals with Democrats than supporting America First candidates. We need to remember that its McConnell who poured millions of dollars into Colorado and Alaska, one being a race where the Republicans *never* could've won, and the other to save Lisa Murkoswki whose *own state party* has censured her.  Murkowski votes for Biden 67% of the time, and no matter what happens in Alaska, a Republican will still win it; there's no reason to dump money over there. Furthermor, McConnell refused to support Masters in Arizona, he refused to support Bolduc in New Hampshire, and he left Walker out to dry. Once these guys announced they wouldn't support McConnell for Senate Majority Leader, McConnell pulled out the cash. **He'd rather stay in power as a minority leader than have the majority for the American people**. This was the ultimate dereliction of leadership.

I'm not saying Trump is or isn't partly responsible for what happened this midterm. But McCarthy and McConnell are our coaches, and we just fumbled *hard.* When you're the coach of a team and you fail to win when everything is pointing to victory, that coach gets fired.

From Politico today:

[6 election security threats to watch for on Election Day ](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/07/6-election-security-threats-to-watch-for-on-election-day-00065277)

> The 2020 presidential election was rife with allegations of voting machine hacks that were later debunked. Yet there are real risks that hackers could tunnel into voting equipment and other election infrastructure to try to undermine Tuesday’s vote.

> Lies and conspiracy theories about the security of election systems are what most worry election supervisors and federal cybersecurity and intelligence officials, because those falsehoods can inflame mistrust that discourages people from voting and provoke anger that spurs people to threaten violence against election administrators.

> Hackers have one relatively low-tech tool for knocking campaigns off balance and disrupting voters’ access to reliable election information: forcing websites to crash using automated tools that simulate massive floods of people visiting those sites.

The people in charge of Fetterman's campaign and more importantly, the people responsible for his health, should be ashamed. That man had no business being on stage in that condition. It wasn't just sad. It was sickening.

These same people hid these serious issues from the voting public for months. They attacked people who questioned his health while locking him away to prevent the truth from getting out.

__Over 800,000 PA voters have already sent back mail-in ballots__. They did this without seeing the true mental state of one of the two major candidates. That is clearly an intentional strategy on the part of the Fetterman campaign and it's is a broken system. They know that nobody could vote for him in good conscience after seeing and hearing him with their own eyes and ears.

This needs to change. Multi-week mail-in voting and early voting periods are wrong. Voters need to hear from candidates _before_ they vote.

The people in charge of Fetterman's campaign and more importantly, the people responsible for his health, should be ashamed. That man had no business being on stage in that condition. It wasn't just sad. It was sickening.

These same people hid these serious issues from the voting public for months. They attacked people who questioned his health while locking him away to prevent the truth from getting out.

__Over 800,000 PA voters have already sent back mail-in ballots__. They did this without seeing the true mental state of one of the two major candidates. That is clearly an intentional strategy on the part of the Fetterman campaign and it's is a broken system. They know that nobody could vote for him in good conscience after seeing and hearing him with their own eyes and ears.

This needs to change. Multi-week mail-in voting and early voting periods are wrong. Voters need to hear from candidates _before_ they vote.

Nine months ago, my account was suspended. It was banned for around 10 days, and then my appeal was granted stating that the initial suspension was in error. As of today, **my account has zero substantiated suspensions and I have never had a single action upheld against me.**

Despite this, during my short suspension, r/LetsGoBrandon was banned for being unmoderated. In the 9 months since this ban, I have repeatedly attempted to contact the Reddit admin team regarding this ban. They have an entire reddit request subreddit designed to claim banned subs, but [when I file a request it is closed because I'm already the top moderator of the subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/ud9069/requesting_rletsgobrandon/)  When I contact them via modmail, I just receive no response. 

I am bringing this issue to your attention today, not because I am all that bothered by the subreddit being banned. At the end of the day, Reddit can do what they wish. However, I want you to understand exactly what the people running this website think of you. They have no problem discriminating against you based on your political viewpoints. They have no problem suppressing your speech, shutting down your communities, even when you bend over backwards to follow their rules.

My subreddit did not have a single message from the admin team telling me that I was not doing my job. I did everything in my power to moderate the community within the guidelines of this site, even when I disagreed with them on a fundamental level. And it wasn't enough. No matter how hard you try to follow their rules, it will never be enough.

Tapper and bash did an amazing job IMO, they both despise trump but treated both candidates fairly. Asked Biden and trump tough questions, allowed them to use their time as they chose, and at no point did I feel like trump was debating the moderators like in previous debates. 

They did cut Biden off to try to save him from himself a few times, but the “okay grandpa” dismissiveness is something everyone watching at home felt too. 

I expected the debate to be incredibly biased against trump, so props where props are due. In all fairness, if they did show their bias it would have only helped trump but it was a rare showing of actual impartiality in an otherwise hellscape of a political climate.

By looking at those parts of Reddit I can sense that Joe Biden has pretty much short-circuited the Reddit zeitgeist. Both pro and anti Biden posts are downvoted to oblivion now, for example posts about Biden should get replaced and the list of candidates to replace Biden gets downvoted and also posts about how Biden should not get replaced and he is the only one to defeat Trump get downvoted as well.

From reading the comments my best guess is that they want to replace Biden with their ideal candidate (which I guess would be Bernie but younger) but when the actual alternatives get listed they rage downvote because in their minds they cannot defeat Trump. So their having an identity crisis of hating Trump so much they wanna ride with Biden but also they realized Biden cannot in any capacity ride that bus across the finish line.

yritu4,McCarthy and McConnell Must Go,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/yritu4/mccarthy_and_mcconnell_must_go/,"*This isn't being said enough*. Blame Trump all you want, but he wasn't on the ballot. This was the Republicans' race to lose, and the party leadership bears the blame. McCarthy tries to present himself as a populist but most view him with distrust as they should. We shouldn't be questioning if we will even win the House, that was supposed to be a forgone conclusion. But if we win it, McCarthy *should not* be rewarded for this disastrous underperformance. Beneath him, Tom Emmer is the chair of the NRCC; he's the guy in charge of the cash. The NRCC directed millions into D+20 districts from California to Michigan, rather than the tossups that Republicans should have been guaranteed to pick up. This alone was pure incompetence at best and sabotage at worst.

McConnell on the other hand is clearly an establishment crony with preference for loyalty and backdoor deals with Democrats than supporting America First candidates. We need to remember that its McConnell who poured millions of dollars into Colorado and Alaska, one being a race where the Republicans *never* could've won, and the other to save Lisa Murkoswki whose *own state party* has censured her.  Murkowski votes for Biden 67% of the time, and no matter what happens in Alaska, a Republican will still win it; there's no reason to dump money over there. Furthermor, McConnell refused to support Masters in Arizona, he refused to support Bolduc in New Hampshire, and he left Walker out to dry. Once these guys announced they wouldn't support McConnell for Senate Majority Leader, McConnell pulled out the cash. **He'd rather stay in power as a minority leader than have the majority for the American people**. This was the ultimate dereliction of leadership.

I'm not saying Trump is or isn't partly responsible for what happened this midterm. But McCarthy and McConnell are our coaches, and we just fumbled *hard.* When you're the coach of a team and you fail to win when everything is pointing to victory, that coach gets fired. Say what you want about candidate quality or messaging, but **we need to clean house; McCarthy and McConnell need to go**.",2518,780,SupremeChancellor66,Conservative,1668095072.0,0.76,/r/Conservative/comments/yritu4/mccarthy_and_mcconnell_must_go/,False

The people in charge of Fetterman's campaign and more importantly, the people responsible for his health, should be ashamed. That man had no business being on stage in that condition. It wasn't just sad. It was sickening.

These same people hid these serious issues from the voting public for months. They attacked people who questioned his health while locking him away to prevent the truth from getting out.

__Over 800,000 PA voters have already sent back mail-in ballots__. They did this without seeing the true mental state of one of the two major candidates. That is clearly an intentional strategy on the part of the Fetterman campaign and it's is a broken system. They know that nobody could vote for him in good conscience after seeing and hearing him with their own eyes and ears.

This needs to change. Multi-week mail-in voting and early voting periods are wrong. Voters need to hear from candidates _before_ they vote.

yritu4,McCarthy and McConnell Must Go,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/yritu4/mccarthy_and_mcconnell_must_go/,"*This isn't being said enough*. Blame Trump all you want, but he wasn't on the ballot. This was the Republicans' race to lose, and the party leadership bears the blame. McCarthy tries to present himself as a populist but most view him with distrust as they should. We shouldn't be questioning if we will even win the House, that was supposed to be a forgone conclusion. But if we win it, McCarthy *should not* be rewarded for this disastrous underperformance. Beneath him, Tom Emmer is the chair of the NRCC; he's the guy in charge of the cash. The NRCC directed millions into D+20 districts from California to Michigan, rather than the tossups that Republicans should have been guaranteed to pick up. This alone was pure incompetence at best and sabotage at worst.

McConnell on the other hand is clearly an establishment crony with preference for loyalty and backdoor deals with Democrats than supporting America First candidates. We need to remember that its McConnell who poured millions of dollars into Colorado and Alaska, one being a race where the Republicans *never* could've won, and the other to save Lisa Murkoswki whose *own state party* has censured her.  Murkowski votes for Biden 67% of the time, and no matter what happens in Alaska, a Republican will still win it; there's no reason to dump money over there. Furthermor, McConnell refused to support Masters in Arizona, he refused to support Bolduc in New Hampshire, and he left Walker out to dry. Once these guys announced they wouldn't support McConnell for Senate Majority Leader, McConnell pulled out the cash. **He'd rather stay in power as a minority leader than have the majority for the American people**. This was the ultimate dereliction of leadership.

I'm not saying Trump is or isn't partly responsible for what happened this midterm. But McCarthy and McConnell are our coaches, and we just fumbled *hard.* When you're the coach of a team and you fail to win when everything is pointing to victory, that coach gets fired. Say what you want about candidate quality or messaging, but **we need to clean house; McCarthy and McConnell need to go**.",2516,780,SupremeChancellor66,Conservative,1668095072.0,0.76,/r/Conservative/comments/yritu4/mccarthy_and_mcconnell_must_go/,False

__Over 800,000 PA voters have already sent back mail-in ballots__. They did this without seeing the true mental state of one of the two major candidates. That is clearly an intentional strategy on the part of the Fetterman campaign and it's is a broken system. They know that nobody could vote for him in good conscience after seeing and hearing him with their own eyes and ears.

They did cut Biden off to try to save him from himself a few times, but the “okay grandpa” dismissiveness is something everyone watching at home felt too. 

I expected the debate to be incredibly biased against trump, so props where props are due. In all fairness, if they did show their bias it would have only helped trump but it was a rare showing of actual impartiality in an otherwise hellscape of a political climate.

I saw family go full Trump is Satan/never Trump, and saw some go full Trump Train Maga. 

I fell victim to the never camp but this election cycle has me questioning. 

For the past few weeks, I’ve been seeing quotes put in every headline, then I would watch the footage and the headlines became painfully obviously skewed.  Most recently “I’m not a Christian” and “You won’t have to vote anymore”

In the footage he clearly states that he is appealing to the Christians who don’t vote to come out and vote just this once.  He’ll do his best to clean up the country and perceived mess it has become.  “Vote for ME this once, I’ll give you what you want, then you can go back to not voting” appealing to those who wouldn’t normally go to the polls to go out and vote.  Like, you know, any candidate would. 

But unfortunately worded, every headline is screaming fascism now and I can’t help but feel like I’m taking crazy pills. 

Edit:

DM’d and told I’m delusional.  Feel like the footage is clear, he said “I’m a Christian” and did not promise authoritarianism. ",401,458,RickyRickyTarnTarn,Conservative,1722128312.0,0.55,/r/Conservative/comments/1edvh5w/okay_this_trump_said_you_wont_have_to_vote_again/,False

I know that the proud boys don’t, but what about all the working class people who buy into his immigrant shtick. You guys remember the South Park episode “they tuk ur jerbs”! I mean, that actually how a lot of people felt and Trump said what all of them had been criticized for saying. And people wonder why the “billionaire” who steals from the poor and gives to the rich would be supported by the proletariat - because he validates their anger. That’s a connection you can’t break, and that’s why Trump is so popular with the working class - that’s what Hitler dialed into as well, blaming the failing economy on some outside ethnic group, just saying the racist crap that the poorly-educated working class majority had been whispering behind closed doors. We’re never gonna have that pull with the working class, or at least the uneducated ones, but why should we. I mean, we should speak to the rest of the educated world, people who don’t want their lives to be pulled up at the roots by a Trump dictatorship. 


I mean, let’s stop playing, Trump isn’t just the fat idiot that lies a lot. Trump is potentially the next “Mein Fuhrer”, and if you don’t want to live in a world where that’s the case, if you don’t want the fruits of AI to go to one individual, for China to seize Taiwan and then the rest of the democratic world crumble under the mighty tyrannical triumvirate, then recognize the fucking threat and do something about it. We’re living in 1933 Germany before Hitler was elected chancellor. He didn’t even win the popular vote, and he used voter intimidation, and nobody stopped him.

in 2021, when it became apparent that trump had lost the election, he insighted an insurrection in an attempt to have his followers overthrow the government and give him another term. attempting to overthrow the government IS treason. all of the rioters who survived that terrible day are being tried for treason and, if there is any justice in the world, they will be convicted.  
  
now, after everything he has done to this country, trump has the fucking audacity to run for president again as if we would want him back. this man who attempted to overthrow the government when it became quite apparent that he had lost.  
  
if you vote for him, you will be committing treason. you will be helping someone who attempted to overthrow the government be put back into a position where he could do it again. if he gets reelected, every single person who voted for him will be guilty of treason and, if there was any justice in the world, they would be tried and convicted for it. i don't care how authoritarian i sound. that is the truth of the matter.

Do vote, and vote on the local, state, and federal level across the board--even third party when the opportunity presents itself (not now though-- that's too risky). Your rights, your freedoms, your citizenry, and even your very life are at stake in the 2024 election--they are on the most consequential ballot box this country has seen in its history.

Call your Senators and your representatives, and tell them your concerns. Be honest and upfront when you make these calls. Write to the president and sign petitions. Again, vote like your goddamn life depends on it because this time around it absolutely does.

Telling someone I am a Dem/Lib is a good way to shoot my own-self in the foot! As we approach the presidential election it’s a popular topic of conversation. It’s one I avoid whenever possible. However, I’ve notice lately an increase in people saying “I’m democrat/liberal/progressive, and I’m not voting for her.” Again where I live, you don’t tell people your affiliation. You just start shit talking the other candidate or put a bumper sticker on your car and bitch about gas prices! IMO Kamala Harris is no brainer. So, am I party blind?

Even when ordered to comply with the Voting Rights Act? GOP state lawmakers refused. So? The Courts became involved.

>*A three-judge panel has struck down Alabama’s congressional map on Tuesday, after GOP state lawmakers refused a court mandate to draw a second majority-Black district.The federal judges wrote that they were “deeply troubled” that the state legislature declined to draw two majority Black districts. The same court ruled last year that it should draw a second majority - Black district to comply with the Voting Rights Act. The Supreme Court affirmed the ruling from the lower court earlier this year.*

I'm very happy we are hearing of compliance - very sad it's forced.

>*An independent court - appointed expert will now draw Alabama’s congressional map for the 2024 election. Republicans in the state are expected to appeal the decision, which could eventually make its way to the Supreme Court again.*

It's 2023, and parts of our country are turning backwards. The Civil Rights Act, Voting Rights Act and others were iimplemented for a reason.

Many of our Congressional representatives, family members, friends and neighbors fought hard and long for the rights that many are attempting to erase / destroy today. However? The Courts have had to step up in individual states as cases move forward.

SCOTUS opened the door (in more ways than one) to stop many rights we assumed would stay in place.

Now, instead of federal laws that cover all states?

Individual states (and Courts in each State) have to fight for the rights of everyone. Rights that used to be there for everyone.

If the States take this illegal activity to SCOTUS for a descsion? 

We are aware of what could happen.

Examples of their conspiracies:

1.There is a space laser controlled by the democratic elite that set hawaii on fire

2. There is an earthquake/tsunami machine in the pacific ocean

3. Covid vaccines have microchips in them

4. Those white cloudy trails behind jets are actually brainwashing chemicals

5. Donald Trump won the 2020 election

6. Michelle obama is a man

NONE of these things are even REMOTELY true. I've done hours of research, showed them videos, audio, pictures, court documents, court testimonies, scientific evidence, and everything else I can find but they still use their backwards logic to make themselves feel right.

19ekt08,"The Consequences if Trump becomes president in 2024 will be severe, but it will be far more catastrophic for America in general, and here’s why I think that:",https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/19ekt08/the_consequences_if_trump_becomes_president_in/,"First and foremost, Republicans. What is their brand? 

Big business, small government, guns, God and family?

Okay, let’s take that second one for a second.

Why would the Republican party who worships the idea of small government be trying to mandate human rights, like women’s right to bodily autonomy? Why would they be attacking LGBTQ+ rights and trying to actively do so through the government? 

It’s a one way attack. They use all their talking points in some way, shape or form to attack others but to also protect themselves. 

Big business? They screw over small businesses.
Small government? We’ve already glossed over how they use the government to attack people’s rights. 
Guns? They love their guns, don’t get me wrong, but they HATE the idea of “the wrong people” having guns of their own. 
God? They use the Bible to justify hate speech and graphic violence on the regular.
And family values? We don’t need to talk about their stance on gun violence in schools or how they screw over the average family, do we? 

My point is; they don’t have much of anything that is able to be picked apart in seconds. 

But with the 2024 election nearing close and the polls seeming to be in Trump’s favor right now, all I can say is things look pretty grim. Not for us, oh no. For America.

Here’s what I think will happen:

First of all, there will be a massive exodus from the Military and Armed Forces. Sure, there might be a small bump once Trump’s in office, but I highly doubt the Republicans are as brawny as they say they are. Deep down inside, I think it’s those who have the spirit to fight for the greater good that have the guts to go out and fight for America. So, more moderate or even left-wing individuals. With the government being ran by bigots who hate left-wingers, most of them will drop out and then the Republicans will be forced to fend for themselves and, well, we’ll see how long that lasts. If they can’t wear a piece of cloth on their face, I don’t think they’ll love wearing battle fatigues 24/7. 

Second, there will be a massive anti-government sentiment as people rally behind their fellow human beings. This one will probably be immediate and noticable. We might even get our own guns this time around, but that’s on the extreme end. I could even find myself having a pistol in my pocket at all times one of these days. 

Schools and churches will shut down as people will realize with these pro-Republican ideals sweeping the nation, there will be a country ripe for gun violence from sea to shining sea, so these churches and schools will close their doors and resort to remote learning to prevent gun violence. 

Next, my life won’t change as much. I’ll probably go nuts with my book, working on art for it, polishing it off before it releases. If they complain about it, I don’t give a damn. 

Public morale will be at an all-time low as we find ourselves so deeply divided and with violent protests every single day, we’ll be forced into a third Wprld War. 

China’s eyeing Taiwan, Russia’s already invaded Ukraine and with WW3 right around the corner, America will require unity between its people to get through this tough time. But we won’t have the ability to become united enough to be willing to fight for America.

If they implement a draft, it will only be god awful news for America. It will show how deeply divided America is to our enemies and it will probably embolden China to attack Taiwan and force Russia to attack Ukraine even worse, only deeper. 

We might see coalitions driving knives of consequence into any chances that Trump has to retain power. Armed militias might form in the US whose sole purpose is to ensure the peaceful transfer of power from Trump to someone else in 2028, and to prevent Trump from removing the part of our constitution which defines 2 terms as the term limit for presidents. It could be the catalyst for a second revolution.

This is highly theoretical, but in the end I know we’ll do the best we can for whoever we can. Right now, America’s not it. At least, for what it’s leaning towards, it’ll suffer the consequences if it strays down this route because in the end we’ll all do what’s best for ourselves, and if this union is causing too many problems perhaps we’ll wake up one day to America paying the price for its own problems. 


Again - highly theoretical, but it’s impossible to not talk about what’s best for ourselves in the long term.",174,74,MisterHoops,Liberal,1706113035.0,0.79,/r/Liberal/comments/19ekt08/the_consequences_if_trump_becomes_president_in/,False

Reddit is the only place where the average person can reach a large amount of people. But why are even liberal subs refusing to listen?

I'm so sick of the same arguments over and over. Our democracy and American lives are more important than anything else right now. Don't blackmail us with a dictator and hold us literally hostage.

(It's not being a bully to warn about a very real threat, its like saying scientists are bullying you over climate change, the only way to get people to listen is to be aggressive about it)

I have trans family members lives on the line here. 

And I rely on Medicaid/ssi which Republicans want to get rid of, I'm physically disabled and can no longer work due to an injury. It might not be their campaign chopping block promise, but If some of the hard core anti socialist republican congress get their way, it will be. Frankly, I don't know how anyone who relies on it can vote Republican, and I especially can't understand a so called liberal being ok about the risk of  losing it by refusing to vote/vote third party and letting Trump win.

**Do not get complacent.** Do not stay home because ""both sides are bad"". Do not assume anything, including that the election's in the bag. Do not panic at the polls but don't ignorantly dismiss them either. **Do not repeat the mistakes of 2016.** Do not attempt to reason with MAGAs--instead, pull the moderates and independents to your side. Do vote, and vote on the local, state, and federal level across the board--even third party when the opportunity presents itself (not now though-- that's too risky). Your rights, your freedoms, your citizenry, and even your very life are at stake in the 2024 election--they are on the most consequential ballot box this country has seen in its history.

Call your Senators and your representatives, and tell them your concerns. Be honest and upfront when you make these calls. Write to the president and sign petitions. Again, vote like your goddamn life depends on it because this time around it absolutely does.

Even when ordered to comply with the Voting Rights Act? GOP state lawmakers refused. So? The Courts became involved.

>*A three-judge panel has struck down Alabama’s congressional map on Tuesday, after GOP state lawmakers refused a court mandate to draw a second majority-Black district.The federal judges wrote that they were “deeply troubled” that the state legislature declined to draw two majority Black districts. The same court ruled last year that it should draw a second majority - Black district to comply with the Voting Rights Act. The Supreme Court affirmed the ruling from the lower court earlier this year.*

I'm very happy we are hearing of compliance - very sad it's forced.

>*An independent court - appointed expert will now draw Alabama’s congressional map for the 2024 election. Republicans in the state are expected to appeal the decision, which could eventually make its way to the Supreme Court again.*

It's 2023, and parts of our country are turning backwards. The Civil Rights Act, Voting Rights Act and others were iimplemented for a reason.

Many of our Congressional representatives, family members, friends and neighbors fought hard and long for the rights that many are attempting to erase / destroy today. However? The Courts have had to step up in individual states as cases move forward.

SCOTUS opened the door (in more ways than one) to stop many rights we assumed would stay in place.

Now, instead of federal laws that cover all states?

Individual states (and Courts in each State) have to fight for the rights of everyone. Rights that used to be there for everyone.

If the States take this illegal activity to SCOTUS for a descsion? 

We are aware of what could happen.

I've come around to the perspective that defeating Trump in the primary is the best way to prevent either of these outcomes.

From [https://nevertrumpv2.com](https://nevertrumpv2.com):

>Democrats, Independents, and Unaffiliated voters should vote Republican in the presidential primary election, and **vote for a candidate other than Trump**.  
The goal is to defeat Trump before the general election, by preventing him from gaining the Republican party presidential nomination.

I’m a Jewish liberal teenage male, and I know I’m prolly not as affected as many would be in a trump victory, but I’m still feeling scared. I’m not sure what I need, maybe a little Hopium couldn’t hurt but I honestly just want a realistic take. I keep very up to date with politics because I like to be informed but it’s feeling straining. I just want a realistic take from someone who actually knows what the hell is going on: how scared should I be? How bad is the situation, and what can I do to help?

1ef0yng,"First time volunteer - this is not a normal election, and I'm getting off the bench. Who's ready to join for the first time?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1ef0yng/first_time_volunteer_this_is_not_a_normal/,"m 40 years old this year, and while I've been politically ""involved"" for 22 years - showing up to vote, keeping tabs on politics, educating myself - I've been on the bench my whole life. Very very rarely donated, and never volunteered.

But everything is starting to change. As an LGBT man growing up in the South, it was so invigorating seeing us making serious progress over the years. If you aren't old enough to remember, a LOT of us were around for the days when being LGBT was literally illegal in over half of the county - it was 2003 when that changed. And that's just one of the major injustices I've seen overthrown in my lifetime, and I'm only 40 years old.

Now, the left is feeling beaten down. Eight years of Trump fatigue and the supreme court has been rough. But the fact of the matter is this - this election is do or die. The Republicans do not intend to EVER lose power again if they win this time around. They literally - among other things - want to eliminate thousands of federal employees and replace them with Trump loyalists. That's not opinion, that's not my take, that's what they wrote down on paper and proudly showed the world. They plan to get rid of the department of education - again, not my opinion, it's literally what they said.

So where am I going with this? Get involved. We need to get involved NOW. There are SO many ways to volunteer, and thousands have signed up, but we still have a LOT of work to do. Republicans are registering more new voters in several swing states than we are, left leaning voters are more likely to stay home and not show up, young voters especially, and turnout is always the left's biggest weak spot.

So I'm volunteering this year, for the first time in any election ever. And I'm trying to create a ripple effect of bringing people with me. Can I get three people - just three people out of all of Reddit - to commit to:

    volunteering with me in some way shape or form

    passing it on, seeking three friends to volunteer as well?

There are SO many ways to volunteer, even if you're not in a state that's up for grabs, and helping the presidential ticket also pretty much always helps down ballot and state level candidates (house, Senate, State Congress, governor, etc.) You can call and text individuals in swing states, you can help try to get people to sign up to vote (they target blue areas, don't worry), you can just reach out to people and give them a nudge that helps increase the odds of them showing up, you can do tech work!

The best thing about volunteering? It's not a job, you don't even have to put in a two week notice if you hate it and want to quit! :)

Let's get this chain going. Who's ready to roll our sleeves up and get this shit done? ",154,31,lotsandlotsofrobots,Liberal,1722263373.0,0.95,/r/Liberal/comments/1ef0yng/first_time_volunteer_this_is_not_a_normal/,False

ynxg4v,Don't Give Them What They Want,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/ynxg4v/dont_give_them_what_they_want/,"I know we don't trust polls anymore but all this ""the Dems are doing great"" talk isn't helpful either. I looked at the polls for the first time and most say we don't have a chance. History says the same thing.   Are we setting ourselves up for giant heartbreak?

I can also already see the MSM headlines on Wednesday morning: Voter's failed/ Voter's have given their stamp of approval on Jan 6./ Voter's want women stuck in the 1950's/ White women hate people of color and are the devil/ Liberals don't care about the environment or democracy...

Even though they all know what the map looks like. The truth is there are many more GOP safe seats up for election this cycle than Dem. There are a ton of GOP uncontested races scattered throughout the country. History says the GOP takes power this cycle. A year ago all we heard was how likely it was for the GOP to take power due to the map.

Can it change? Sure.  Does that guarantee the GOP win? No.  But we all believed Trump couldn't win  -even though history said he would. Simply because he had an R next to his name.  I don't believe young voters have been given enough attention. And I believe they're going to be missing this cycle.

A lot of us are EXHAUSTED. We have worked hard. Participated. Donated. Voted. Volunteered. Won by historical numbers.   And yet we lost Roe. We have violence at the Capitol and dead children in our schools. We can't afford anything. We are using more oil than ever.  Voting rights are being taken away.  WW3 is knocking at our doorstep.

All of this should encourage us to work HARDER. But that's not always how humans work. We're exhausted. And we feel like the system is stacked against us. No matter what we do. And that even if we win, we still lose. We've all become disenfranchised to some extent. (Which is THE GOAL BTW)

I'm on a tangent now.  But the main point is don't let the MSM divide us further.   If we lose the midterms it's because the deck was stacked against us to begin with. And the GOP/Internet/Fox has propagandized their voters for years now. We literally live in two different realities. We get completely different news everyday. They're going to vote for the candidate with an R next to their name. Even when it's against their own interest.

Don't blame your teammates if we lose the midterms. ( I'm not speaking of the party itself, just the voters ). Don't let the MSM get away with blaming them either. Those who think like you, or similar enough to you, are not the problem.  It's going to suck enough. If we keep dividing ourselves, we will continue to lose our freedoms, progress and hope.

Hopefully, we win and my message isn't needed. Just throwing it out there because I'm already seeing signs of blame on MSM.",34,22,CitizenMillennial,Liberal,1667757657.0,0.82,/r/Liberal/comments/ynxg4v/dont_give_them_what_they_want/,False

10ndtwj,WHEN FOXES RULE THE HEN HOUSE.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/10ndtwj/when_foxes_rule_the_hen_house/," 

An overwhelming number of Republicans want the House to address issues important to them. During the midterms promises were made that the matter of inflation, crime, and the southern border would be center-stage and a bi-partisan effort would be made to correct these problems. 

Do you want to know what happened to those promises? the whackos took over and are now promising us a new wave of Benghazi-like investigations, and like the eight Benghazi (Costing some seven million dollars) nothing will come of them except the opportunity to try and embarrass President Biden. 

Eight separate tribunals, seven million dollars, and at the end of the fiasco, Hillary, sitting alone and without benefit of counsel -- over the course of twelve hours -- answered all their questions and figuratively spat in their eye! 

Chairman Gowdy finally admitted nothing was accomplished by the two-year, four-month investigation. 

Now they are up to it again. 

Representatives who themselves are now under investigation by the FBI (Jim Jordan, who sat on the Benghazi committee) want to investigate the FBI. That’s like having Benedict Arnold sitting on his own jury or allowing George Santos to swear to the veracity of the witnesses. 

Maybe the FBI should be investigated, they are proving to be a real nuisance to Chinese spy rings, corporate crime (Their just announced indictment of Google), and political corruption, to say nothing of their investigation of 1/6 and the self-same Republican Representatives alleged to have been involved in the attempted coup.

The GOP will have to rally behind Trump during the proceedings lest they be chastised by the base, stifling any possibility of competition to Trump in the primaries.

So if that happens, what next? Will there be mass-killings? Will there be a cultural revolution like in Maoist China where everyone that voted democrat is subjected to dehumanization?

FLDems neglected organizing and retail campaigning two years ago and got curb stomped. Manny Diaz ran for state party chair promising to clean up the mess, but then promptly ignored the lessons learned and now in 2022 we have another disaster.

Thankfully, FL Sen. Shevrin Jones has articulated a call to prioritize year-round organizing and offering solutions to skyrocketing costs of living impacting constituents instead of scattershot messaging about the GOP culture war and consultant lead election season scrambling.

I encourage everyone to read his statement regarding the causes and solutions for the current state of the FLDems.

1eikytq,What kind of prosecutor was Kamala Harris? Setting the facts straight,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1eikytq/what_kind_of_prosecutor_was_kamala_harris_setting/,"I've seen in a lot of comments, and heard from some friends in real life as well, opinions that are very negative about Kamala's experience as a district attorney and then attorney general. Basically anyone claiming ""Kamala was a cop"".

Looking into this, I did a lot of research and wanted to share just some of the things I found. First, I think it's important to acknowledge that being a prosecutor is a tough job, one that deals with tough moral situations, especially as part of a social justice system that is often biased and unfair. I doubt there's a prosecutor in the country who I agree with as a liberal on every decision. But despite this, prosecutors obviously serve a crucially important role in any legal system. And it is really simply incorrect to claim that Kamala was just ""a cop"", or inherently or entirely illiberal in her legal record.

  
1. Harris had a liberal record for the time on marijuana prosecution. While DA of San Francisco, her office's policy [was to not seek jail time for mere possession](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/trump-claims-harris-jailed-thousands-and-thousands-of-black-people-over-marijuana-but-her-actual-record-as-a-prosecutor-is-more-nuanced/). Only a handful of people were jailed for possession under her tenure, most probably for extenuated issues. 

Of course, since then the Biden-Harris administration [reclassified marijuana](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/30/1248205659/marijuana-reclassify-biden-less-restrictions) and she's the first mainstream [presidential candidate to be pro-legalization](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dariosabaghi/2024/07/22/where-does-kamala-harris-stand-on-marijuana/).

2. One of Harris' biggest initatives as DA was ""Back on Track"", which provided housing, job training, and substance abuse treatment for nonviolent offenders charged with drug possession. [The program was really successful](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2020/08/10/kamala-harris-progressive-pioneer-san-francisco-da-column/3334668001/), greatly reducing the rate of re-offenses, and [saved tax payers money](https://bja.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh186/files/Publications/BackonTrackFS.pdf). In the end, it was so successful that other cities around the country like [Baltimore](https://www.baltimoresun.com/2015/05/14/mosby-new-program-gives-nonviolent-offenders-a-second-chance/) and Philly copied it as well.

3. She's always been consistently against the [death penalty](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/466546-harris-campaign-releases-ad-on-opposition-to-death-penalty/). As [written in 2004](https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/New-D-A-promises-to-be-smart-on-crime-Harris-2831205.php) when she was elected to SF DA: ""Harris has pledged to continue Hallinan's practice of supporting patients receiving medical marijuana, refusing to seek the death penalty and prosecuting three-strike offenders only for serious or violent felonies."" 

""It takes much more than building prisons and locking away prisoners to keep our city safe,"" Harris said.

4. As AG, she created a [new division and initiative](https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-launches-initiative-reduce-recidivism) to help first time offenders reintegrate in society and avoid repeat crimes. She also [refused to enforce Prop 8](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/harris-vows-to-abandon-prop-8/1860319/), the ban on gay marriage on California eventually declared unconstitutional. 

For more, see: [Public defender: I worked with Kamala Harris. She was the most progressive DA in California](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2020/08/10/kamala-harris-progressive-pioneer-san-francisco-da-column/3334668001/).

**Now, who did Harris really prosecute hard? Large corporations, polluters, and banks.**

5. She [fought for big banks to pay $20 billlion to California home owners during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, and won](https://fortune.com/2024/07/22/kamala-harris-jamie-dimon-settlement-california-homeowners-big-banks-financial-crisis/).

6. She also won a $1.1 billion settlement [from a predatory for-profit school](https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-obtains-11-billion-judgment-against-predatory): “For years, Corinthian profited off the backs of poor people – now they have to pay. This judgment sends a clear message: there is a cost to this kind of predatory conduct,” said Attorney General Harris. “My office will continue to do everything in our power to help these vulnerable students obtain all available relief, as they work to achieve their academic and professional goals.”

6. She pushed for the [passage of the Homeowner's Bill of Rights in California](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/calif-attorney-general-kamala-harris-fights-for-struggling-homeowners/), and won [hundreds of millions](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-suntrust-mortgage-settlement-20140618-story.html) back for homeowners from banks for multiple abuses.

7. She recovered [hundreds of millions](https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/california-to-receive-hundreds-of-millions-in-bank-of-america-settlement-mortgage-kamala-harris-department-of-justice/) for state pensions from Bank of America who mismanaged their investments in 2009. 

8. She won $[241 million from ](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-xpm-2011-may-20-la-fi-quest-settlement-20110520-story.html)a company overcharging Medi-Cal, and [$323 million from another](https://legalnewsline.com/stories/510527871-harris-323m-scan-settlement-record-recovery-for-calif-program). 

9. She held [shipping companies behind an oil spill](https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/44-million-settles-Cosco-Busan-oil-spill-in-bay-2308869.php) responsible for $44 million for environmental clean-up, [fined a company behind a pipeline](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-santa-barbara-county-oil-spill-20160517-snap-story.html) spill in Santa Barbara, and [fined BP and Arco $14 million for unsafe oil storage](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/BP-Arco-to-pay-14-million-in-suit-over-gas-10621426.php) practices.

19eyrng,Kind of Wild/Creative’: Emails Shed Light on Trump Fake Electors Plan,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/19eyrng/kind_of_wildcreative_emails_shed_light_on_trump/,"Previously undisclosed communications among Trump campaign aides and outside advisers provide new insight into their efforts to overturn the election in the weeks leading to Jan. 6.
 https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/26/us/politics/trump-fake-electors-emails.html?smid=nytcore-android-share

""Previously undisclosed emails provide an inside look at the increasingly desperate and often slapdash efforts by advisers to President Donald J. Trump to reverse his election defeat in the weeks before the Jan. 6 attack, including acknowledgments that a key element of their plan was of dubious legality and lived up to its billing as “fake.”

The dozens of emails among people connected to the Trump campaign, outside advisers and close associates of Mr. Trump show a particular focus on assembling lists of people who would claim — with no basis — to be Electoral College electors on his behalf in battleground states that he had lost.

In emails reviewed by The New York Times and authenticated by people who had worked with the Trump campaign at the time, one lawyer involved in the detailed discussions repeatedly used the word “fake” to refer to the so-called electors, who were intended to provide Vice President Mike Pence and Mr. Trump’s allies in Congress a rationale for derailing the congressional process of certifying the outcome. And lawyers working on the proposal made clear they knew that the pro-Trump electors they were putting forward might not hold up to legal scrutiny.

“We would just be sending in ‘fake’ electoral votes to Pence so that ‘someone’ in Congress can make an objection when they start counting votes, and start arguing that the ‘fake’ votes should be counted,” Jack Wilenchik, a Phoenix-based lawyer who helped organize the pro-Trump electors in Arizona, wrote in a Dec. 8, 2020, email to Boris Epshteyn, a strategic adviser for the Trump campaign.""",31,2,Desperate_Wafer_8566,Liberal,1706150265.0,0.84,/r/Liberal/comments/19eyrng/kind_of_wildcreative_emails_shed_light_on_trump/,False

1e07ld7,I think Biden should stay in the race.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1e07ld7/i_think_biden_should_stay_in_the_race/,"Maybe I took too many copium pills, but... after an acute case from carsickness from ridin' with Biden.... I actually think we should get back in the Biden car.

1) **Biden's poll numbers are not too bad.**

[On March 2nd, Trump was leading Biden by 2.1 points.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/)  Biden managed to obtain a small lead over Trump after Trump's court trial but lost it after the debate.  It is now.... a 2.1 point lead, the same as it was earlier in the year.

People say the debate was a disaster for Biden but at the end of the day, we have to look at the **data**, not our own emotions.  All the debate seems to have done is pushed us back to the status quo earlier in the year.   This is a setback but it is not an irrecoverable setback.  

2) **There are events that can turn this ship around**

There is still a second debate where Biden has a chance to recover from his first debate.  There will likely be a vice presidential debate.  Strong showings in those events can cancel out an initial disastrous debate performance.

Furthermore, Trump's legal troubles are not over.  Trump will be sentenced in his hush money trial on September 18th.  And while there won't be a trial in regards to Trump's role in the January 6th riots, [there will be hearings to determine which of Trumps actions in relation to that day were official](https://www.newsweek.com/jack-smith-silver-lining-supreme-court-ruling-trump-election-interference-1919962).  This would at least allow Trumps crimes to gain publicity right before the election.  Remember.... the only time Biden was ahead in the polls was when Trump's legal troubles were in the news.

3)  **The Kennedy voters are likely to go back to Trump or Biden.**

Gary Johnson, in 2016, was at one point polling at over 10% of the vote.  In the end, he got only 3.3% of the vote.  Ross Perot got 19% of the presidential vote in 1992, Kennedy isn't even breaking 9% of the vote.

It's difficult to say who exactly Kennedy is taking votes away from, but from what I have seen on 538, in polls where Kennedy is excluded, Biden tends to do better.  In short, it is possible Kennedy is obscuring voters who will vote for Biden come November.

4) **Known unknowns**

If we're going to abandon Biden after one bad debate performance, if we swap Biden out, what would it take to get us to lose faith in his replacement?  

I haven't seen Kamala Harris at all these four years, she's a total unknown to me.  And I actually read the news!  If Biden is replaced by someone who is low profile in comparison, how is that going to look to voters?

Biden is a known quantity, that means his flaws, just like Trump's flaws, are known quantities.  So the question is.... can we work with what we have to win the election.  Which brings me to my final point.

5) **Biden is fit to lead us because he is leading us now!**

If you are American, Biden is YOUR president.  He oversees the government, commands the military, negotiates with foreign powers and upholds our country's values, traditions, and honor.  If our service men and women, who put their lives on the line for America, follow Biden as their Commander in Chief, why should any Democrat be less willing to support Biden as their candidate?

Allan Lichtman, the author of ""The 13 Keys to the White House"" and who has successfully predicted 9 (IMHO, technically 10) of the past 10 presidential elections had this to say.

> “Debate performances can be overcome.  At the first sign of adversity the spineless Democrats want to throw under the bus, their own incumbent president. My goodness.” 

Honestly.... I think he's right.  In any great enterprise, setbacks happen.

Do I send that money to feed the poor overseas or do I buy that new shirt that I've been eyeing? I've especially been thinking about this in light of the new MLK, Jr. biography.

To that end, the post-presidency of Barack Obama has been, perhaps like his presidency, fairly underwhelming to me. At least from my point of view, he doesn't seem that interested in ensuring Democratic victories these days. Like a lot of wealthy people, he seems less passionate about politics than he used to.

I was wondering if other people on here wish that Barack Obama were more involved in the day to day political battle in this country? do you wish that he had a nightly show on CNN or MSNBC? and separate from that, do you think that such a show, or perhaps being at political rallies in much greater numbers or appearing on TV interviews multiple times per week, would significantly improve the Dems' chances of winning elections? and finally, on an 'ethical living' level, do you think that Obama has a responsibility to do more on a day to day basis than he seems to be? I know that he couldn't accomplish the long-term things that he cares about if he was having to do a TV show every day. I'm just not sure what would benefit others the most.

ztaudo,How to Use Reddit to Positively Influence the World,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/ztaudo/how_to_use_reddit_to_positively_influence_the/,"I’ve found an effective way to generate conversations and open people’s minds. I post high-quality articles on local subreddits both to inform people, and create opportunities for discussion. Sometimes there’s ignorant comments, but usually some informed and well-spoken Redditor will step in and deal with them.

Here’s what I do:

I enjoy reading the higher quality newspapers in my state. When I find something good, I share it. First on subreddit for that city/ region, then I crosspost to the state subreddit. Going local helps engage people who are turned off by national politics, or who might be brainwashed by bogus media outlets. Hyperpartisan media tend to only focus on national news, but can be outflanked by going local, because local papers haven’t been smeared as agents of the lizard people. If you don't have any good local papers, you could also use Google Alerts to catch reportage on your town.

The best results have these elements:

**Informative**

Go for long-form journalism that everyone would find interesting and worthwhile to read. Without being too jargony, the more research, facts, and analysis the article provides, the better. After reading it, it should be clear to the reader why they should care. Genuine understanding helps people feel calm and secure because they actually have useful knowledge to better navigate this crazy world. It works the opposite of alt-right media, which gives limited understanding and aims to provoke an emotional reaction. Give people something worth knowing. In order to refute an article, doubters will have to post contradictory information of the same quality, which might not exist. By pushing them to do some independent research, you’re effectively getting them to think for themselves instead of rehashing whatever Fox news says.

**Local Subs**

If an article specifically mentions a city or county, be sure to post it there. Posting articles on State subs will get more views, but the articles linger longer on city and regional subs. You could post on international subs too, but ideally you want a diverse group of people to see it, so avoid ideological subs. The intended audience is not the well-informed who go on Reddit daily (and who probably already lean left), but those who go on once a month or less. Many people use Reddit periodically just to find the answer to a problem. To have an impact, you want to reach people who aren’t already on your team. Yes, Reddit already has a selection bias, but the information you share will eventually find its way onto other social media and real life conversations.

**Non-partisan**

Facts don’t pick a side, and a good article will take aim at all parties that are wrong, left and right. People should feel they’re getting the real story, not a doctored version of it. If trolls claim an article is lizardman propaganda, kindly ask them for a link to another source. Keep the conversation focused on verified facts. Don’t get too drawn into debating with trolls. 

**Community- Building**

Articles that help people connect in real life are useful. Most bigots have limited exposure to different opinions and social backgrounds. Anything that helps reduce people’s social and intellectual isolation helps to put them on a better path by attacking the vacuum of awareness from which their bigotry was formed. Local events, clubs, businesses are all places where strangers can brush shoulders and get some insight. Articles referring to places, events, and memories we all have in common, help to build an inclusive sense of “we”. It helps to bridge the reality/ internet divide.

Here are some examples of the newspapers I post from:

12u01ks,"The Liberal Economic Message Should Be: It's Not About Jobs, It's About Quality-of-Life",https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/12u01ks/the_liberal_economic_message_should_be_its_not/,"In the media and oftentimes in any type of political debate, the economic argument often boils down to jobs. They say people want jobs, people want to work. Even Democrats fall prey to this trap.

But it's not about jobs. It's about quality-of-life.

People want to be able to work to achieve the quality-of-life that they desire. Whether that means being able to afford an international vacation every year, or simply means having every weekend off to go fishing and read, if that's what it means to have the quality-of-life you desire, the true manifestation of the American Dream is to be able to put in a respectable amount of working labor, to achieve this end.

The Right tries to twist this and say that the Left just wants to be lazy, and not have to work. That's not true. 

Most reasonable people understand that they have to work for the quality of life that they desire. So a job is not the ultimate goal, it is simply a means to an end.

The problem that Liberals want to address, is that the balance between working and quality of life, in today's American society, is currently completely torn apart. As it stands now, way too many people have to work two jobs, or hours upon hours of overtime, or intense manual labor that grinds you down to the bone and shortens your lifespan, and it doesn't even get them to a decent quality of life, let alone the quality of life they actually want.

The only ones who want it this way are the profiteering company executives that the Republican Party is always constantly giving all glorification to. If my basic needs of society are being met, do I really lose out if the employees who provide those services are getting paid sick leave, or getting paid a decent living wage? No, it shouldn't matter one way or the other; but likewise, I have absolutely zero desire for them to have anything less. So when politicians in this country are driving policies such as blocking universal healthcare, blocking affordable education, blocking affordable housing, what they're really doing is, forcing people to work longer and harder than they really should have to, just to get the quality of life they want. Ensuring the cheapest labor has no choice but to keep working until they drop dead. 

At the very least, we need to understand that the workers who have to work the hardest to achieve the quality of life that they want, are always generally going to be minimum-wage workers. Value-wise alone, their labor earns generally earns them the least amount, just in raw numbers. Additionally, they are always under the fiercest economic pressure, because for employers they will always be the most easily-replaced compared to their more-educated, more skilled counterparts; and when we have a national economic policy that encourages an always present significant population of unemployed labor (again, who ever really wants that, other than business owners?). 

The Liberal economic message is about achieving the quality-of-life people want, while working reasonable jobs. Policy should be driven towards keeping necessities like housing, healthcare, and transportation affordable, making sure wages keep up with inflation, fiscal policy that keeps inflation low, ideally a combination of both. 

And ensure that a basic quality of life, that doesn't shorten your lifespan or leave you miserable, does not require working two jobs or working yourself to the bone, so that people will then actually have more freedom to pursue even better quality of life than that.",33,7,pierre_x10,Liberal,1682079839.0,0.95,/r/Liberal/comments/12u01ks/the_liberal_economic_message_should_be_its_not/,False
1c2e028,Anti women propaganda and whitewashing the past ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1c2e028/anti_women_propaganda_and_whitewashing_the_past/,"
TLDR:  propagandists are rewriting the past about misogyny -  denying it happened.  

I'm shell shocked,  pretty upset after decades of working so hard for equal rights, I'm seeing them implode in one generation. 

I am a het male, but I was defending trans women,  and once you post links to facts and studies and  people refuse to accept, there's no where to go. I give up. 

So I asked the commenter to at least remember, years back when women wanted to be called Ms. ( No one's business if they are single), demanded credit in their own name, demanded equal pay, complained about the glass ceiling, denial of reproductive  health care, about not being allowed in certain jobs, etc.  people back then seriously rolled their eyes, demeaned women,  harassed and assaulted them for demanding equal rights.

There were even women who took the side of men and ranted that feminists should shut up,  stay home with the kids, stop destroying men's lives by taking away men's rights ...  

 They talked about them in the same way people talk about marginalized people today. 

As we can all agree now, they were on the wrong side of history.  

Except the redditor responded angrily by calling bullshit on my rendition of the past. They said it was third wave feminism ( no clue what that is). 

And then the kicker - they said that women not getting paid the same was a MYTH. 

WTF. A Myth! 

I was there. I was alive then. My sisters were alive then and they lived it. They are still alive and can attest to it, as can many other women. This shit happened. 

Misogyny was rampant. 

There were actually child raising books that warned parents  to not allow their daughter's expectations to get too high, don't give them too much education or their daughters would be upset and depressed when in the end they would just be stay at home moms. 

I had friends who screamed with frustration because they wanted to be architects or scientists  and they were shuttled to ""interior decorating"". 

And yes, I had sisters who were paid less than their male counterparts.

 I remember news show debates where it was explained that men are the breadwinners and women left the workforce to get pregnant anyway, so that was why men were paid more. 

These things HAPPENED.  They are real. I am not making them up. 

This is like serious Holocaust denial type BS. Like Florida under Desantis teaching that there are upsides to slavery for slaves BS. 

I googled and found out there is actually a movement to diminish the heinous misogyny that women suffered in the past.  This person who denied my take on history says she is a woman in her 30s. She may not be, maybe she is some male who is pining for the good old days.  I have no idea. 

But I'm disgusted. Something terrible is happening. Brave New World Dystopian Gilead terrible.  

Is there some Jordan Peterson for women Tik Tok? No idea. But it didn't take long to revert. Between the denial of history and trump and an 1864 abortion law resurrection, I'm beginning to think like water seeking its own level humans gravitate toward authoritarianism. I wonder if Democracy and the dream of equal rights was just a blip. 

I had to let it out somewhere. I had to say something.  So I wrote about it here. Hoping folks can tell me it ain't so bad.

I think the debate crystallized something that I already knew, which is that this election may very well be lost. Maybe likely lost.

And yet, I also notice a major contradiction in my actions:  I'm not doing anything about it.

Of course I will vote for whoever the Democratic nominee is.  But beyond that, I have no concrete plans to do anything about it.

I want to remind everyone that arguing and discussing things on Reddit, Facebook, etc. isn't doing anything about it. Throwing the Democrats a few bucks isn't doing anything about it. If you can do it on the toilet, it doesn't count.

Doing politics -- that is, getting people to vote or change their vote -- is really, really hard, boring, unrewarding work. Doing something about it involves sacrifices of time -- free time -- and energy and lots of money. Travel.  Inter-state travel. Sacrifice that might affect your job, your video game time, your time with kids, your hobbies, your exercise regimen. Sacrifice day in and day out, not just one-offs.

I say this as someone who, at the moment, can't be bothered to do much more than vote. So, I guess I'm admitting that things aren't *so* bad that I'm going to do anything about it.

How bad do things need to get before I start sacrificing time and energy to effect change?  I don't know. But I do know, that if I look at myself in the mirror and am honest, I'm not going to do anything else.  I don't know what this really means.

To these ""what can I do about it posts,"" we all know the answer.  It's boring stuff like volunteer for campaigns, join advocacy groups, attend local government meetings, engage in protests, community projects, educate on policy issues, run for office, boycott misaligned businesses, and so on.  And I'm not going to do any of that, if I'm honest.  Not a chance.  Not now, anyway.

Please forgive the rambling -- but my point is this: don't kid yourself.  Posting on Reddit and arguing with anonymous internet people isn't going to change the outcome.  If you're scared, like I am, then ask yourself why you're not doing more.  If you figure it out, please let me know.

1ep4cqj,The supreme court interfering with the election,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1ep4cqj/the_supreme_court_interfering_with_the_election/,"So im very hopeful about a Harris win. The polls are looking good, but way too close. 


What I'm terrified of is faithless electors and the supreme court siding with them. 

Why is nothing being done to stop it? Why is nobody sounding the alarm?

They've been ranting about Harris being a coup, when it's nothing but projection. They're the ones planning the coup. 

They have been since 2020.  

I don't trust the supreme court. Can't Biden just remove them with his power if that happens? Can't Biden refuse to leave? Or what if he stepped down and let Harris be president so she can use her supreme court given authority to stop it?

The sc did it with Bush V Gore, but gore willingly stepped down, I pray Harris doesn't make the same mistake. I know we want to be the party of order, but at the same time we can't let them cheat.

I know in the past they've ruled that electors can't cheat, but who the fuck knows anymore what they'll do after the immunity ruling, and R v w.

19ekt08,"The Consequences if Trump becomes president in 2024 will be severe, but it will be far more catastrophic for America in general, and here’s why I think that:",https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/19ekt08/the_consequences_if_trump_becomes_president_in/,"First and foremost, Republicans. What is their brand? 

Big business, small government, guns, God and family?

Okay, let’s take that second one for a second.

Why would the Republican party who worships the idea of small government be trying to mandate human rights, like women’s right to bodily autonomy? Why would they be attacking LGBTQ+ rights and trying to actively do so through the government? 

It’s a one way attack. They use all their talking points in some way, shape or form to attack others but to also protect themselves. 

Big business? They screw over small businesses.
Small government? We’ve already glossed over how they use the government to attack people’s rights. 
Guns? They love their guns, don’t get me wrong, but they HATE the idea of “the wrong people” having guns of their own. 
God? They use the Bible to justify hate speech and graphic violence on the regular.
And family values? We don’t need to talk about their stance on gun violence in schools or how they screw over the average family, do we? 

My point is; they don’t have much of anything that is able to be picked apart in seconds. 

But with the 2024 election nearing close and the polls seeming to be in Trump’s favor right now, all I can say is things look pretty grim. Not for us, oh no. For America.

Here’s what I think will happen:

First of all, there will be a massive exodus from the Military and Armed Forces. Sure, there might be a small bump once Trump’s in office, but I highly doubt the Republicans are as brawny as they say they are. Deep down inside, I think it’s those who have the spirit to fight for the greater good that have the guts to go out and fight for America. So, more moderate or even left-wing individuals. With the government being ran by bigots who hate left-wingers, most of them will drop out and then the Republicans will be forced to fend for themselves and, well, we’ll see how long that lasts. If they can’t wear a piece of cloth on their face, I don’t think they’ll love wearing battle fatigues 24/7. 

Second, there will be a massive anti-government sentiment as people rally behind their fellow human beings. This one will probably be immediate and noticable. We might even get our own guns this time around, but that’s on the extreme end. I could even find myself having a pistol in my pocket at all times one of these days. 

Schools and churches will shut down as people will realize with these pro-Republican ideals sweeping the nation, there will be a country ripe for gun violence from sea to shining sea, so these churches and schools will close their doors and resort to remote learning to prevent gun violence. 

Next, my life won’t change as much. I’ll probably go nuts with my book, working on art for it, polishing it off before it releases. If they complain about it, I don’t give a damn. 

Public morale will be at an all-time low as we find ourselves so deeply divided and with violent protests every single day, we’ll be forced into a third Wprld War. 

China’s eyeing Taiwan, Russia’s already invaded Ukraine and with WW3 right around the corner, America will require unity between its people to get through this tough time. But we won’t have the ability to become united enough to be willing to fight for America.

If they implement a draft, it will only be god awful news for America. It will show how deeply divided America is to our enemies and it will probably embolden China to attack Taiwan and force Russia to attack Ukraine even worse, only deeper. 

We might see coalitions driving knives of consequence into any chances that Trump has to retain power. Armed militias might form in the US whose sole purpose is to ensure the peaceful transfer of power from Trump to someone else in 2028, and to prevent Trump from removing the part of our constitution which defines 2 terms as the term limit for presidents. It could be the catalyst for a second revolution.

This is highly theoretical, but in the end I know we’ll do the best we can for whoever we can. Right now, America’s not it. At least, for what it’s leaning towards, it’ll suffer the consequences if it strays down this route because in the end we’ll all do what’s best for ourselves, and if this union is causing too many problems perhaps we’ll wake up one day to America paying the price for its own problems.

It's that whichever justices on SCOTUS aided Trump in evading justice for what he did on 1/6 (those justices likely being Alito, Thomas, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and maybe Roberts) also getting away with this.  This is especially considering the fact that they not only are aiding and abetting Trump in delaying the 1/6 trial past the election, but they gave Trump the boost that he needed in the 2024 election, since polls shown Biden way ahead of Trump when asked who they would vote for if Trump was convicted in the 1/6 case.  The reason why I think that the SCOTUS justices that shielded Trump from being held accountable getting away with it is even worse than Trump getting away with what he did on 1/6 is because SCOTUS is supposed to be all about the law and justice, but most of the conservative justices are doing the opposite as they are basically the reason as to why Trump is on the brink of getting away with what he did on 1/6.  If Trump not only avoids accountability, but becomes president again and drops the 1/6 case, I really hope there is some possible way that the conservative SCOTUS justices that helped make this possible do not get away with this at all.

1e07ld7,I think Biden should stay in the race.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1e07ld7/i_think_biden_should_stay_in_the_race/,"Maybe I took too many copium pills, but... after an acute case from carsickness from ridin' with Biden.... I actually think we should get back in the Biden car.

1) **Biden's poll numbers are not too bad.**

[On March 2nd, Trump was leading Biden by 2.1 points.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/)  Biden managed to obtain a small lead over Trump after Trump's court trial but lost it after the debate.  It is now.... a 2.1 point lead, the same as it was earlier in the year.

People say the debate was a disaster for Biden but at the end of the day, we have to look at the **data**, not our own emotions.  All the debate seems to have done is pushed us back to the status quo earlier in the year.   This is a setback but it is not an irrecoverable setback.  

2) **There are events that can turn this ship around**

There is still a second debate where Biden has a chance to recover from his first debate.  There will likely be a vice presidential debate.  Strong showings in those events can cancel out an initial disastrous debate performance.

Furthermore, Trump's legal troubles are not over.  Trump will be sentenced in his hush money trial on September 18th.  And while there won't be a trial in regards to Trump's role in the January 6th riots, [there will be hearings to determine which of Trumps actions in relation to that day were official](https://www.newsweek.com/jack-smith-silver-lining-supreme-court-ruling-trump-election-interference-1919962).  This would at least allow Trumps crimes to gain publicity right before the election.  Remember.... the only time Biden was ahead in the polls was when Trump's legal troubles were in the news.

3)  **The Kennedy voters are likely to go back to Trump or Biden.**

Gary Johnson, in 2016, was at one point polling at over 10% of the vote.  In the end, he got only 3.3% of the vote.  Ross Perot got 19% of the presidential vote in 1992, Kennedy isn't even breaking 9% of the vote.

It's difficult to say who exactly Kennedy is taking votes away from, but from what I have seen on 538, in polls where Kennedy is excluded, Biden tends to do better.  In short, it is possible Kennedy is obscuring voters who will vote for Biden come November.

4) **Known unknowns**

If we're going to abandon Biden after one bad debate performance, if we swap Biden out, what would it take to get us to lose faith in his replacement?  

I haven't seen Kamala Harris at all these four years, she's a total unknown to me.  And I actually read the news!  If Biden is replaced by someone who is low profile in comparison, how is that going to look to voters?

Biden is a known quantity, that means his flaws, just like Trump's flaws, are known quantities.  So the question is.... can we work with what we have to win the election.  Which brings me to my final point.

5) **Biden is fit to lead us because he is leading us now!**

If you are American, Biden is YOUR president.  He oversees the government, commands the military, negotiates with foreign powers and upholds our country's values, traditions, and honor.  If our service men and women, who put their lives on the line for America, follow Biden as their Commander in Chief, why should any Democrat be less willing to support Biden as their candidate?

Allan Lichtman, the author of ""The 13 Keys to the White House"" and who has successfully predicted 9 (IMHO, technically 10) of the past 10 presidential elections had this to say.

> “Debate performances can be overcome.  At the first sign of adversity the spineless Democrats want to throw under the bus, their own incumbent president. My goodness.” 

Honestly.... I think he's right.  In any great enterprise, setbacks happen. But in deciding whether to stay the course vs setting out into the unknown, you first and foremost need to listen to reason, and discipline your thoughts with the data.  And I simply don't see the rational case for replacing Biden with another presidential candidate.",131,69,Spare-Dingo-531,Liberal,1720647155.0,0.87,/r/Liberal/comments/1e07ld7/i_think_biden_should_stay_in_the_race/,False

On to the drama. I was in the registrar's office for maybe a total of 4 minutes. It was really fast. As I'm putting my ballot into the machine, a guy walks through the door behind me. They try pointing him to where he needs to go and he says loudly, ""I'm not here to vote. I'm here to get a vote count."" 

A poll worker across from him asks who he is. ""I'm John Smith. I'm the [important position] for the 123 congressional district GOP."" I don't remember all of his credentials.

The poll worker asks if he has a letter stating his representation. John Smith repeats his long flowing title again. The poll worker says, ""I heard that, but if you don't have a letter stating your representation, then you need to leave.""

Clearly miffed, John Smith says, ""Sorry to bother you"" and heads out the door.

It's insane this is even a possibility. I seriously don't understand how its even this close. Wtf is wrong with this country? And I mean the UNCOMMITTED left too.

What makes me worry is because of  how close the polls are, how every model is predicting it will be incredibly close. 

Why the hell has Georgia seemingly flipped back (I hope the polls are actually wrong) to Trump, and Pennsylvania, a traditionally blue state, is now suddenly purple?



How the hell do polls keep changing so much in the first place? I refuse to believe that people are changing their minds every other week. This doesn't make any sense, even if you are a Trump supporter you should see this doesn't make sense.

I looked at the polls for the first time and most say we don't have a chance. History says the same thing.   Are we setting ourselves up for giant heartbreak?

I can also already see the MSM headlines on Wednesday morning: Voter's failed/ Voter's have given their stamp of approval on Jan 6./ Voter's want women stuck in the 1950's/ White women hate people of color and are the devil/ Liberals don't care about the environment or democracy...

Even though they all know what the map looks like. The truth is there are many more GOP safe seats up for election this cycle than Dem. There are a ton of GOP uncontested races scattered throughout the country. History says the GOP takes power this cycle. A year ago all we heard was how likely it was for the GOP to take power due to the map.

Can it change? Sure.  Does that guarantee the GOP win? No.  But we all believed Trump couldn't win  -even though history said he would. Simply because he had an R next to his name.  I don't believe young voters have been given enough attention. And I believe they're going to be missing this cycle.

A lot of us are EXHAUSTED. We have worked hard. Participated. Donated. Voted. Volunteered. Won by historical numbers.   And yet we lost Roe. We have violence at the Capitol and dead children in our schools. We can't afford anything. We are using more oil than ever.  Voting rights are being taken away.  WW3 is knocking at our doorstep.

All of this should encourage us to work HARDER. But that's not always how humans work. We're exhausted. And we feel like the system is stacked against us. No matter what we do. And that even if we win, we still lose. We've all become disenfranchised to some extent. (Which is THE GOAL BTW)

I'm on a tangent now.  But the main point is don't let the MSM divide us further.   If we lose the midterms it's because the deck was stacked against us to begin with. And the GOP/Internet/Fox has propagandized their voters for years now. We literally live in two different realities. We get completely different news everyday. They're going to vote for the candidate with an R next to their name. Even when it's against their own interest.

Don't blame your teammates if we lose the midterms. ( I'm not speaking of the party itself, just the voters ). Don't let the MSM get away with blaming them either. Those who think like you, or similar enough to you, are not the problem.  It's going to suck enough. If we keep dividing ourselves, we will continue to lose our freedoms, progress and hope.

Hopefully, we win and my message isn't needed. Just throwing it out there because I'm already seeing signs of blame on MSM.",33,22,CitizenMillennial,Liberal,1667757657.0,0.82,/r/Liberal/comments/ynxg4v/dont_give_them_what_they_want/,False
1d157qr,Things that Irk Me Further Regarding the J6 Trial Delay,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1d157qr/things_that_irk_me_further_regarding_the_j6_trial/,"I mentioned on here several times how upsetting it is that SCOTUS is aiding and abetting Trump in delaying the DC Election Interference trial until after the election, however, there are two additional things on this matter that irk me further.

The first is that there are several folks who plan to vote for Biden in Nov, but not only disagree with me over the fact that if Trump wins the election and we lose our democracy, that it will be the Supreme Court's fault, but they even think that it will be Biden and the Democrats fault.  How is it that they are turning a blind eye to the fact that polls have shown that when folks were asked who they'd vote for if Trump was convicted, Biden, despite his massive unpopularity, easily defeats him?  I mean, based off of what the latest polling has shown us, SCOTUS isn't just helping Trump delay the J6 trial, but they are basically giving the 2024 election to him by taking away the one thing that would've hurt Trump's current momentum.  This proves that SCOTUS will be the ones to blame if Trump wins in Nov.

The second is how there are even folks that will not be supporting Trump in Nov, but are defending all of the Supreme Court's decisions that help Trump delay the trial.  I mean, what reason do they have to defend SCOTUS for the fact that are aiding and abetting Trump in delaying the trial, especially when it consequently boosts his chances of him winning the election given the latest polling.  Even more baffling is how several of those folks think that even the liberal justices voted in favor of all the decisions that benefited Trump's plan to delay the trial.  Before the immunity hearing, I was worried that even the liberals might've been in on the plan, but during the arguments, Jackson signaled that she was in opposition of the plan to help Trump delay the trials, and then a recent interview Sotomayor did signals that she was in opposition as well, which only leaves Kagan as the liberal justice that I'm unsure about.

With that said, I'm curious to know what your thoughts are.",29,11,jonasnew,Liberal,1716741153.0,0.75,/r/Liberal/comments/1d157qr/things_that_irk_me_further_regarding_the_j6_trial/,False

Who's ready to join for the first time?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1ef0yng/first_time_volunteer_this_is_not_a_normal/,"m 40 years old this year, and while I've been politically ""involved"" for 22 years - showing up to vote, keeping tabs on politics, educating myself - I've been on the bench my whole life. Very very rarely donated, and never volunteered.

But everything is starting to change. As an LGBT man growing up in the South, it was so invigorating seeing us making serious progress over the years. If you aren't old enough to remember, a LOT of us were around for the days when being LGBT was literally illegal in over half of the county - it was 2003 when that changed. And that's just one of the major injustices I've seen overthrown in my lifetime, and I'm only 40 years old.

Now, the left is feeling beaten down. Eight years of Trump fatigue and the supreme court has been rough. But the fact of the matter is this - this election is do or die. The Republicans do not intend to EVER lose power again if they win this time around. They literally - among other things - want to eliminate thousands of federal employees and replace them with Trump loyalists. That's not opinion, that's not my take, that's what they wrote down on paper and proudly showed the world. They plan to get rid of the department of education - again, not my opinion, it's literally what they said.

So where am I going with this? Get involved. We need to get involved NOW. There are SO many ways to volunteer, and thousands have signed up, but we still have a LOT of work to do. Republicans are registering more new voters in several swing states than we are, left leaning voters are more likely to stay home and not show up, young voters especially, and turnout is always the left's biggest weak spot.

So I'm volunteering this year, for the first time in any election ever. And I'm trying to create a ripple effect of bringing people with me. Can I get three people - just three people out of all of Reddit - to commit to:

    volunteering with me in some way shape or form

    passing it on, seeking three friends to volunteer as well?

There are SO many ways to volunteer, even if you're not in a state that's up for grabs, and helping the presidential ticket also pretty much always helps down ballot and state level candidates (house, Senate, State Congress, governor, etc.) You can call and text individuals in swing states, you can help try to get people to sign up to vote (they target blue areas, don't worry), you can just reach out to people and give them a nudge that helps increase the odds of them showing up, you can do tech work!

The best thing about volunteering? It's not a job, you don't even have to put in a two week notice if you hate it and want to quit! :)

The article was reporting on a Judge's opinion written about one of the pro-trump court cases filed after the 2020 election. I think it was a censure of the lawyers who submitted the case because it was so far off from a legitimate legal challenge that it should never have come close to a courtroom, but I don't recall the details.   
  
The thing that stood out was that the judge described some of the ""evidence"" used in the filing. One example was roughly that a guy was walking his dog down the street and saw postal workers loading black bags into a postal van. The guy thought the bags might have been fraudulent ballots headed to the counting center nearby.  
  
That was it. Just a guy walking his dog thought some black bags might be ballots. That was their ""evidence"" of fraud.  
  
I kind of couldn't believe it so at the time I was able to find the original court filing and sure enough, they really had ""testimony"" from a guy who was walking his dog and saw postal workers loading bags into a van. As far as we know, they could have been early christmas cards, but these lawyers really thought that was sufficient evidence to include in a real lawsuit alleging voter fraud.

[ChatGPT Response](https://chatgpt.com/share/dd6d61db-0e96-4edc-810d-e56a1011293b)

I think this is a good thing to reflect on. A lot of these aren't followed often by people on our side or on the other side. Although my perception is that people on our side, liberals tend to adhere to these more than conservatives. But I will acknowledge that's just my perception gleamed from personal experiences which are anecdotes.

The points ChatGPT made are listed below. Note that in the response there are more details under each point. For the sake of brevity I didn't quote the entire thing, but it's a relatively short read. I recommend going to the link I provided and reading it.

>1. **Be Respectful and Civil**

>2. **Use Evidence-Based Arguments**

>3. **Understand the Opposing Viewpoint**

>4. **Be Clear and Concise**

>5. **Ask Questions**

>6. **Use Empathy**

>7. **Be Patient**

>8. **Stay Informed and Updated**

>9. **Use Positive Framing**

>10. **Tailor Your Message**  




ChatGPT also provided an example:

>Instead of saying: ""Your stance on climate change is ignorant and harmful.""

>Try: ""I used to be skeptical about climate change too, but after looking into the scientific evidence from sources like NASA and the IPCC, I realized how serious the issue is. What sources do you rely on for information about climate change?""

I know it's just a Large Language Model and ChatGPT isn't always accurate, but I feel like when I think about these they're common sense. I feel like the more people apply these principles the more successful they'll be in promoting their views.

Looking towards the election, maybe if enough of us are strategic in how we frame issues it will help the Democrats win not just the presidency but offices up and down the ballot!",3,8,plinocmene,Liberal,1717573628.0,0.58,/r/Liberal/comments/1d8kblh/chat_gpt_on_how_to_convert_people_politically/,False

I know that the proud boys don’t, but what about all the working class people who buy into his immigrant shtick. You guys remember the South Park episode “they tuk ur jerbs”! I mean, that actually how a lot of people felt and Trump said what all of them had been criticized for saying. And people wonder why the “billionaire” who steals from the poor and gives to the rich would be supported by the proletariat - because he validates their anger. That’s a connection you can’t break, and that’s why Trump is so popular with the working class - that’s what Hitler dialed into as well, blaming the failing economy on some outside ethnic group, just saying the racist crap that the poorly-educated working class majority had been whispering behind closed doors. We’re never gonna have that pull with the working class, or at least the uneducated ones, but why should we. I mean, we should speak to the rest of the educated world, people who don’t want their lives to be pulled up at the roots by a Trump dictatorship. 


I mean, let’s stop playing, Trump isn’t just the fat idiot that lies a lot. Trump is potentially the next “Mein Fuhrer”, and if you don’t want to live in a world where that’s the case, if you don’t want the fruits of AI to go to one individual, for China to seize Taiwan and then the rest of the democratic world crumble under the mighty tyrannical triumvirate, then recognize the fucking threat and do something about it.

Who's ready to join for the first time?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1ef0yng/first_time_volunteer_this_is_not_a_normal/,"m 40 years old this year, and while I've been politically ""involved"" for 22 years - showing up to vote, keeping tabs on politics, educating myself - I've been on the bench my whole life. Very very rarely donated, and never volunteered.

But everything is starting to change. As an LGBT man growing up in the South, it was so invigorating seeing us making serious progress over the years. If you aren't old enough to remember, a LOT of us were around for the days when being LGBT was literally illegal in over half of the county - it was 2003 when that changed. And that's just one of the major injustices I've seen overthrown in my lifetime, and I'm only 40 years old.

Now, the left is feeling beaten down. Eight years of Trump fatigue and the supreme court has been rough. But the fact of the matter is this - this election is do or die. The Republicans do not intend to EVER lose power again if they win this time around. They literally - among other things - want to eliminate thousands of federal employees and replace them with Trump loyalists. That's not opinion, that's not my take, that's what they wrote down on paper and proudly showed the world. They plan to get rid of the department of education - again, not my opinion, it's literally what they said.

So where am I going with this? Get involved. We need to get involved NOW. There are SO many ways to volunteer, and thousands have signed up, but we still have a LOT of work to do. Republicans are registering more new voters in several swing states than we are, left leaning voters are more likely to stay home and not show up, young voters especially, and turnout is always the left's biggest weak spot.

So I'm volunteering this year, for the first time in any election ever. And I'm trying to create a ripple effect of bringing people with me. Can I get three people - just three people out of all of Reddit - to commit to:

    volunteering with me in some way shape or form

    passing it on, seeking three friends to volunteer as well?

There are SO many ways to volunteer, even if you're not in a state that's up for grabs, and helping the presidential ticket also pretty much always helps down ballot and state level candidates (house, Senate, State Congress, governor, etc.) You can call and text individuals in swing states, you can help try to get people to sign up to vote (they target blue areas, don't worry), you can just reach out to people and give them a nudge that helps increase the odds of them showing up, you can do tech work!

The best thing about volunteering? It's not a job, you don't even have to put in a two week notice if you hate it and want to quit! :)

1e07ld7,I think Biden should stay in the race.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1e07ld7/i_think_biden_should_stay_in_the_race/,"Maybe I took too many copium pills, but... after an acute case from carsickness from ridin' with Biden.... I actually think we should get back in the Biden car.

1) **Biden's poll numbers are not too bad.**

[On March 2nd, Trump was leading Biden by 2.1 points.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/)  Biden managed to obtain a small lead over Trump after Trump's court trial but lost it after the debate.  It is now.... a 2.1 point lead, the same as it was earlier in the year.

People say the debate was a disaster for Biden but at the end of the day, we have to look at the **data**, not our own emotions.  All the debate seems to have done is pushed us back to the status quo earlier in the year.   This is a setback but it is not an irrecoverable setback.  

2) **There are events that can turn this ship around**

There is still a second debate where Biden has a chance to recover from his first debate.  There will likely be a vice presidential debate.  Strong showings in those events can cancel out an initial disastrous debate performance.

Furthermore, Trump's legal troubles are not over.  Trump will be sentenced in his hush money trial on September 18th.  And while there won't be a trial in regards to Trump's role in the January 6th riots, [there will be hearings to determine which of Trumps actions in relation to that day were official](https://www.newsweek.com/jack-smith-silver-lining-supreme-court-ruling-trump-election-interference-1919962).  This would at least allow Trumps crimes to gain publicity right before the election.  Remember.... the only time Biden was ahead in the polls was when Trump's legal troubles were in the news.

3)  **The Kennedy voters are likely to go back to Trump or Biden.**

Gary Johnson, in 2016, was at one point polling at over 10% of the vote.  In the end, he got only 3.3% of the vote.  Ross Perot got 19% of the presidential vote in 1992, Kennedy isn't even breaking 9% of the vote.

It's difficult to say who exactly Kennedy is taking votes away from, but from what I have seen on 538, in polls where Kennedy is excluded, Biden tends to do better.  In short, it is possible Kennedy is obscuring voters who will vote for Biden come November.

4) **Known unknowns**

If we're going to abandon Biden after one bad debate performance, if we swap Biden out, what would it take to get us to lose faith in his replacement?  

I haven't seen Kamala Harris at all these four years, she's a total unknown to me.  And I actually read the news!  If Biden is replaced by someone who is low profile in comparison, how is that going to look to voters?

Biden is a known quantity, that means his flaws, just like Trump's flaws, are known quantities.  So the question is.... can we work with what we have to win the election.  Which brings me to my final point.

5) **Biden is fit to lead us because he is leading us now!**

If you are American, Biden is YOUR president.  He oversees the government, commands the military, negotiates with foreign powers and upholds our country's values, traditions, and honor.  If our service men and women, who put their lives on the line for America, follow Biden as their Commander in Chief, why should any Democrat be less willing to support Biden as their candidate?

Allan Lichtman, the author of ""The 13 Keys to the White House"" and who has successfully predicted 9 (IMHO, technically 10) of the past 10 presidential elections had this to say.

> “Debate performances can be overcome.  At the first sign of adversity the spineless Democrats want to throw under the bus, their own incumbent president. My goodness.” 

Honestly.... I think he's right.  In any great enterprise, setbacks happen. But in deciding whether to stay the course vs setting out into the unknown, you first and foremost need to listen to reason, and discipline your thoughts with the data.  And I simply don't see the rational case for replacing Biden with another presidential candidate.",129,69,Spare-Dingo-531,Liberal,1720647155.0,0.87,/r/Liberal/comments/1e07ld7/i_think_biden_should_stay_in_the_race/,False

Today I decided that “Dictator Don” would be far better since it references the actual threat he poses. And then I thought, why turn it into a fun alliteration? Let’s make it real. “Dictator Trump."" Now it’s no longer a nickname. It’s a potential reality. People need to shudder at the sound of it.

Anyway, while CO and CA did the right thing, we can't allow one or two states to block a candidate for the entire US. Who's to say R's wouldn't convince forever red states like WY or the Dakotas to do the same thing against Biden or any Dem in the future.

1eikytq,What kind of prosecutor was Kamala Harris? Setting the facts straight,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1eikytq/what_kind_of_prosecutor_was_kamala_harris_setting/,"I've seen in a lot of comments, and heard from some friends in real life as well, opinions that are very negative about Kamala's experience as a district attorney and then attorney general. Basically anyone claiming ""Kamala was a cop"".

Looking into this, I did a lot of research and wanted to share just some of the things I found. First, I think it's important to acknowledge that being a prosecutor is a tough job, one that deals with tough moral situations, especially as part of a social justice system that is often biased and unfair. I doubt there's a prosecutor in the country who I agree with as a liberal on every decision. But despite this, prosecutors obviously serve a crucially important role in any legal system. And it is really simply incorrect to claim that Kamala was just ""a cop"", or inherently or entirely illiberal in her legal record.

  
1. Harris had a liberal record for the time on marijuana prosecution. While DA of San Francisco, her office's policy [was to not seek jail time for mere possession](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/trump-claims-harris-jailed-thousands-and-thousands-of-black-people-over-marijuana-but-her-actual-record-as-a-prosecutor-is-more-nuanced/). Only a handful of people were jailed for possession under her tenure, most probably for extenuated issues. 

Of course, since then the Biden-Harris administration [reclassified marijuana](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/30/1248205659/marijuana-reclassify-biden-less-restrictions) and she's the first mainstream [presidential candidate to be pro-legalization](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dariosabaghi/2024/07/22/where-does-kamala-harris-stand-on-marijuana/).

2. One of Harris' biggest initatives as DA was ""Back on Track"", which provided housing, job training, and substance abuse treatment for nonviolent offenders charged with drug possession. [The program was really successful](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2020/08/10/kamala-harris-progressive-pioneer-san-francisco-da-column/3334668001/), greatly reducing the rate of re-offenses, and [saved tax payers money](https://bja.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh186/files/Publications/BackonTrackFS.pdf). In the end, it was so successful that other cities around the country like [Baltimore](https://www.baltimoresun.com/2015/05/14/mosby-new-program-gives-nonviolent-offenders-a-second-chance/) and Philly copied it as well.

3. She's always been consistently against the [death penalty](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/466546-harris-campaign-releases-ad-on-opposition-to-death-penalty/). As [written in 2004](https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/New-D-A-promises-to-be-smart-on-crime-Harris-2831205.php) when she was elected to SF DA: ""Harris has pledged to continue Hallinan's practice of supporting patients receiving medical marijuana, refusing to seek the death penalty and prosecuting three-strike offenders only for serious or violent felonies."" 

""It takes much more than building prisons and locking away prisoners to keep our city safe,"" Harris said.

4. As AG, she created a [new division and initiative](https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-launches-initiative-reduce-recidivism) to help first time offenders reintegrate in society and avoid repeat crimes. She also [refused to enforce Prop 8](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/harris-vows-to-abandon-prop-8/1860319/), the ban on gay marriage on California eventually declared unconstitutional. 

For more, see: [Public defender: I worked with Kamala Harris. She was the most progressive DA in California](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2020/08/10/kamala-harris-progressive-pioneer-san-francisco-da-column/3334668001/).

**Now, who did Harris really prosecute hard? Large corporations, polluters, and banks.**

5. She [fought for big banks to pay $20 billlion to California home owners during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, and won](https://fortune.com/2024/07/22/kamala-harris-jamie-dimon-settlement-california-homeowners-big-banks-financial-crisis/).

6. She also won a $1.1 billion settlement [from a predatory for-profit school](https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-obtains-11-billion-judgment-against-predatory): “For years, Corinthian profited off the backs of poor people – now they have to pay. This judgment sends a clear message: there is a cost to this kind of predatory conduct,” said Attorney General Harris. “My office will continue to do everything in our power to help these vulnerable students obtain all available relief, as they work to achieve their academic and professional goals.”

The GOP controls the lower chamber (but not my reps), and the Governor's side is R but won't be up for re-election until 2025.

So I don't know what I can actively do because the races I can get involved in are already Dem. Voter reg drive feels a little excessive. Also I'm not in a position where I can travel very far. I want to help with those red states and swing states that *need* it, but they're so far away.

Simply giving money to candidates outside of my area feels... well I understand money helps, but there's so many other places it could go, and my wallet only goes so far. Besides, it doesn't feel like *I'm* making a difference, I'm putting in the work. *I* want to do the thing.

ynxg4v,Don't Give Them What They Want,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/ynxg4v/dont_give_them_what_they_want/,"I know we don't trust polls anymore but all this ""the Dems are doing great"" talk isn't helpful either. I looked at the polls for the first time and most say we don't have a chance. History says the same thing.   Are we setting ourselves up for giant heartbreak?

I can also already see the MSM headlines on Wednesday morning: Voter's failed/ Voter's have given their stamp of approval on Jan 6./ Voter's want women stuck in the 1950's/ White women hate people of color and are the devil/ Liberals don't care about the environment or democracy...

Even though they all know what the map looks like. The truth is there are many more GOP safe seats up for election this cycle than Dem. There are a ton of GOP uncontested races scattered throughout the country. History says the GOP takes power this cycle. A year ago all we heard was how likely it was for the GOP to take power due to the map.

Can it change? Sure.  Does that guarantee the GOP win? No.  But we all believed Trump couldn't win  -even though history said he would. Simply because he had an R next to his name.  I don't believe young voters have been given enough attention. And I believe they're going to be missing this cycle.

A lot of us are EXHAUSTED. We have worked hard. Participated. Donated. Voted. Volunteered. Won by historical numbers.   And yet we lost Roe. We have violence at the Capitol and dead children in our schools. We can't afford anything. We are using more oil than ever.  Voting rights are being taken away.  WW3 is knocking at our doorstep.

All of this should encourage us to work HARDER. But that's not always how humans work. We're exhausted. And we feel like the system is stacked against us. No matter what we do. And that even if we win, we still lose. We've all become disenfranchised to some extent. (Which is THE GOAL BTW)

I'm on a tangent now.  But the main point is don't let the MSM divide us further.   If we lose the midterms it's because the deck was stacked against us to begin with. And the GOP/Internet/Fox has propagandized their voters for years now. We literally live in two different realities. We get completely different news everyday. They're going to vote for the candidate with an R next to their name. Even when it's against their own interest.

Don't blame your teammates if we lose the midterms. ( I'm not speaking of the party itself, just the voters ). Don't let the MSM get away with blaming them either. Those who think like you, or similar enough to you, are not the problem.  It's going to suck enough. If we keep dividing ourselves, we will continue to lose our freedoms, progress and hope.

Hopefully, we win and my message isn't needed. Just throwing it out there because I'm already seeing signs of blame on MSM.",31,22,CitizenMillennial,Liberal,1667757657.0,0.82,/r/Liberal/comments/ynxg4v/dont_give_them_what_they_want/,False

Republicans have found a way to tear slowly erode different sacred areas of our lives and the government through repetition and fear mongering, there has to be a similar but opposite way to mobilize people in order to support important institutions, specifically libraries in this instance. Does anyone have any ideas, or are there any playbooks for how we can organize in a meaningful way to push back against hate groups that are trying to push religious agendas?

It feels like one of the great things about Bernie and the BLM movement is that they organized lots of people—but one of the things that was never capitalized on enough by the Democratic Party is making sure to find an area and productive way to focus those energies, aside from voting for a candidate.

IMO his mug shot was practiced. Even the tilt if his head / hair - perfactly hairsprayed as he smirked into the camera. And? Right before he went up the ramp to return to Bedminster? He made a speech that should convince everyone of his guilt and seal his political aspirations closed.  Has anyone read the [14 Admentment](https://www.senate.gov/about/origins-foundations/senate-and-constitution/14th-amendment.htm#)? It's clear that he can't be elected. Who will enforce it?
