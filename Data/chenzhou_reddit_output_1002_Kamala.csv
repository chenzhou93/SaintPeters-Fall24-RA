26,1fsve1w,Feeling so disheartened ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kamala/comments/1fsve1w/feeling_so_disheartened/,"Sorry for the long post. I live in Florida and ordered two Harris Walz signs weeks ago. They finally arrive. I put one up and gave the other sign to my neighbor. 

A mere two days later I had a package delivered and needed to sign for it. The guy starts talking about my Harris sign. ""I see you have the sign up. Did you hear they are flying in missles to assassinate Trump"" I'm like ""oh I didnt hear that. That's awful. "" 

I was polite bc I'm alone at home. As a woman I know better than to put him in his place for talking about politics while on the job in a uniform.  He finishes the conversation by saying ""there's a lot of crazy people out there"" three times while looking at my sign and looking back at me. I felt threatened and so I took my sign down. My neighbor tells me he will not take his sign down and that it's bs to be intimidated by this guy. He's right. Two days later my neighbors yard sign is stolen. 

I'm so angry at the trump supporters in my area. I've spent years looking at trump signs in my neighborhood. I have never said anything rude or taken a sign down. I'm going to buy another for my neighbor and keep replacing them. 

I just want to discuss this with other people who may have had something similar happen to them.  Thanks for reading.

81,1fp7eoc,Increasing support from young male voters ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kamala/comments/1fp7eoc/increasing_support_from_young_male_voters/,"I've been thinking a lot about the disconnect between young male voters and Kamala Harris' campaign. These voters are new to politics, they may be less informed, and often they are not as wealthy as the typical Reddit user. Many among them we simply cannot reach, however the one's we can reach, have some really important characteristics:

1. They love their mothers, sisters, aunts, wives/girlfriends. The women in their lives are important to them.

2. When they hear lies like ""after birth abortion"" they don't know how to respond. They might agree in the moment just because they don't know. However, if we talk to them with empathy, they will listen.

3. They are still figuring out what what kind of men they want to be. This is going to be a long process for them.

So what can we do about it?

I think we need to remind them of that love they hold for the women in their lives. Remind them of how much they care and how far they willing to go to protect the women they care about.

As for political lies, we can keep presenting them with clear facts about abortion, women's health care, and reproductive needs. We can also work to better provide real time fact checking to political lies as they happen. Don't let the lies breathe, counter them on the spot.

As for examples, we can lean more into Tim Walz. As a veteran, husband, and father, he will appeal to their own images of themselves while demonstrating what it means to be a man who supports Kamala Harris. We can also bring in more Gen X and older men are presenting similar examples.

These men need role models, us men who support Kamala Harris can be those role models.

In 1939 Hitler spread the stench of tyranny in Poland, now fascist sheriff Bruce Zuchowski is doing the same here at home.

Taking a leaf from Trump's MAGA Manifesto, Project 2025, to wit:

""decimate privacy protections for anyone other than U.S. citizens and green card holders. This allows for the weaponization of information-sharing that exposes names, birthdates, addresses, and photographs of individuals encountered at the border and nearly any other foreign national, including children and legally present visa holders, thereby exposing them to potential harm, harassment, or discrimination. \[139\] \[165\]8\]

...create a show-me-your-papers style mandate and task ICE Deportation Officers with removing, arresting, and detaining immigration violators anywhere in the United States, without warrant where appropriate. This would lead to increased racial profiling and discrimination against Latinos, immigrants and other people of color. \[142\]

he has asked his radicalized supporters to help him compile a list of those who MAGA considers to be at odds with their white nationalist xenophobia, so a record will exist of those who will be subject to retribution when he is reelected.

Sinclair Lewis foretold of this in his 1935 dystopian novel, ""It can't happen Here'.

It can happen here -- it is happening here!

See this -- boldface mine.



Ben Wolford·September 16, 2024·

Portage County Sheriff Bruce Zuchowski seemed to encourage his friends and supporters to **write down th**e **addresses of people with Democratic yard signs,** sparking accusations of voter intimidation. In identical posts to his personal and public Facebook accounts on Sept. 13, Zuchowski wrote what he claims to tell people who ask him what will happen if Vice President Kamala Harris wins the presidential election. **Using dehumanizing language, he says he tells them to record the addresses of people with Harris yard signs** in order to house immigrants with them.

**“When people ask me…What’s gonna happen if the Flip – Flopping, Laughing Hyena Wins?? I say…write down all the addresses of the people who had her signs in their yards!** Sooo…when the Illegal human “Locust” (which she supports!) Need places to live…We’ll already have the addresses of the their New families…who supported their arrival!” the posts stated, along with accompanying pictures of a television tuned to Fox News. 

**In the comments under the post on his personal Facebook page, one supporter replied with the name and street of someone with a Harris sign. “I’ll add that name to the list,” another replied. Someone else commented, “Making a list and checking it twice.” As of Sept. 15, that post had hundreds of reactions and over 100 shares.**

There is more, much more:

Despite numerous lies by him that he has no knowledge of the multi-restrictive legislative proposals, voters know better than to believe anything he says.

""If his mouth is open, he's lying"" is a commonly repeated refrain.

Project 2025 will undo centuries of governmental design, replace experts in management and organization with hand picked stooges with no expertise other than in fawning over their tin God.

Remember 'Brownie,' the Bush appointee who couldn't even get water delivered to the suffering New Orleans masses after Katrina? Picture 50,000 inept clones.

Project 2025 will, among other things, institute a national ban on abortion, extremely curtail veteran rights, reduce Social Security benefits, eliminate overtime pay, eliminate Obamacare and provide no alternative, politicize the Justice Department so only hand-picked criminals will be prosecuted while corporations and crooked politicians walk free, and this is just the beginning of the travesties the dictator will implement on day one!

Here's an interactive site that will answer all your questions about this extreme measure; [https://www.25and.me/?topics=](https://www.25and.me/?topics=)

Here are poll results indicating just how much Americans fear project 2025 and its implementation by a Republican victory in the fall.:

Matt Canter, a pollster from Global Strategy Group, on Wednesday briefed Democratic campaign staffers, political consultants, advocacy organizations and journalists about a poll conducted from Aug. 22 to Aug. 28 in 27 states, focusing on 63 ""battleground"" congressional districts up for grabs in November's election.

Canter said Project 2025 ""has penetrated the electorate in a very difficult and noisy environment.""

And that's bad news for Trump and Republicans running down ballot from him for congressional seats. The poll touched on congressional districts in six swing states – Arizona, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – expected to determine who wins the presidency. The poll was sponsored by the advocacy groups End Citizens United, Third Way and MoveOn as a road map for making sure Project 2025 doesn't just stick to Trump but also gets linked to Republicans seeking House seats.

Canter called that ""an exciting opportunity to play offense.""

""Nearly two-thirds of voters report hearing or seeing something about Project 2025, and the disdain runs deep,"" he said. ""And it's not just Democratic base voters driving animosity. We see a majority of the swing voters that have heard are familiar with Project 2025 are deeply unfavorable as well.""

Vance has an agenda of his own. The MAGA movement, unaware of the suppression of rights and liberties already outlined in Trump's MAGA Manifesto, Project 2025, is fertile ground for a new, even more extremist movement that will require every citizen to adhere to principles Margret Atwood never dreamed of.

If J.D. isn't already bat-shit loony enough, it has now been revealed his real motivation is to subsume the MAGA movement and turn it into a hyper religious sect based on ultra-orthodox Catholic zealotry so far to the right Father Coughlin would repudiate it.

He is smiling and outwardly supporting Trump, but this snake-in-the grass Judas has blinded Trump with so much flattery and fawning faux admiration the Orange Man can't see the deviousness through the acclaim.

Check this out -- boldface mine.



Sofia Nelson, a lawyer and former Yale Law School classmate of Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance, warned on Saturday that the Ohio senator is working to **""hijack"" former President Donald Trump's Make America Great Again (MAGA**) movement in favor of a far more rigid and **orthodox theocracy called post-liberalism.** In op-ed for MSNBC published Saturday morning, Nelson said that the post-liberal movement, unlike MAGA, seeks to replace existing social and political power structures with orde**rs rooted in conservative Catholic social teachings.**

Nelson contends that post-liberalists, like Vance, seek to position themselves within the MAGA movement with the aim of inheriting **Trump's political base** once he leaves politics. Their goal is to turn the **GOP into a pro-theocracy party,** Nelson said. The op-ed warns about the danger of a post-liberal rise and the need to counteract it, not just for the sake of defeating Trump, but to maintain the democratic values underpinning U.S. society.

""There is some policy overlap between MAGA and post-liberalism in their shared opposition, for example, to immigration and transgender rights. But the ideological overlap between the groups is a shared affinity for authoritarianism,"" Nelson wrote. **""The post-liberal right, which has goals that even MAGA Republicans would find extreme, is attempting to hijack the MAGA** movement to push its own agenda.""

Nelson befriended Vance and his wife, Usha Vance, while they were attending Yale Law School. Nelson, who is transgender and uses they/them pronouns, had a falling out with **JD Vance** when he launched his political career and backed bans on transgender minors receiving gender-affirming care. They told CNN's Erin Burnett in July that the senator's shift in opinions were motivated by his **ambition for ""political power and wealth.""**

In the op-ed, Nelson pointed to Vance's alleged influences within the post-liberal movement.

""Despite the time we spent as friends, I have no real insights (other than **political expediency)** into what drew him to post-liberal men like the academic Patrick Deneen, columnist Sohrab Ahmari, legal scholar Adrian Vermeule and expat journalist and author Rod Dreher, who was present for **Vance's baptism into the Catholic Church in 2019,""** Nelson wrote. ""What I do know is that **Vance used to condemn Trump's racism a**nd be empathetic to how such rhetoric made Americans feel unwelcome in their own country. But these men have had an obvious and heartbreaking effect on Vance's worldview.""

**Nelson said Vance's ""obsession""** with birth rates and his remarks about childless women reflect his post-liberal belief structure. They also point out that Vance's comments in favor of eliminating ""no-fault divorce"" drifts further to the right on marriage issues than what is contained in **The Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 initiative,** a political movement led by conservative think tanks that aim to shape the next Republican administration's policies.

Trump has repeatedly denied having any relation to **Project 2025,** but many of its contributors are former members of his administration, and his own platform, called **Agenda 47, shares broad policy similarities on several issues.**

And you giggle when he and Vance stick it to the immigrants by making outlandish charges. Well, look where it leads. Your kids go to the threatened schools, too. Sure, so far the cowardly bomb threats and assassinations in Springfield, Ohio, have been as false as Trump's promises, but when will that change? Face it, thus far nearly every shooter has been from a heavily armed family -- and they aren't Democrats.

When will one of you red-eyed, malignant MAGA morons, go overboard on the provocative lies and actually make good on the threats. You know who I mean, the ones already on the edge -- the disaffected and disturbed -- those who require only a little more goading and incitement to believe, like the Insurgents of 1/6, that he is following out Trump's orders.

Those will be your kids getting shredded with the rest.

**For the second day in a row,** elementary school children in Springfield, Ohio, were forced to be **due to threats: a bomb threat on Thursday and an unspecified threat on Friday.** The threats come after **Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio U.S. Senator JD Vance,** have repeatedly **spread lies** about Haitian immigrants in Springfield this week, including that they are **stealing residents’ cats and dogs and eating them.**

Thursday’s **bomb threat specifically mentioned the false claims** about Haitian immigrants eating people’s pets, USA Today reported.

“Three schools in Springfield were evacuated or closed Friday, based on guidance from police, school officials said,” local NBC affiliate WLWT reports. “Officials with the Springfield City School District said that based on information they got from the Springfield Police Division, **students at Perrin Woods and Snowhill Elementary were evacuated** and moved to another district location.”

A Springfield middle school was also ordered closed Friday morning, before classes began, and “at least one Springfield location of the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles is closed.”

On Thursday, a **bomb threat targeting Springfield city hall** and an elementary school forced evacuations of those buildings.

“Police Chief Allison Elliott said that due to the

officials evacuated multiple buildings in addition to City Hall, including BMV Springfield Driver’s Exam Station, Ohio License Bureau Southside, Springfield Academy of Excellence and Fulton Elementary School.”

Despite the reports of the bomb threat on Thursday, hours late**r Donald Trump** used his Truth Social platform to promote the Republican nominee working to unseat Democratic U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, by **spreading more anti-Haitian immigrant racism.**

There's ore, much more:

Glowering like a puppy about to be eaten by an immigrant, Trump made a bigger jackass out of himself than he usually does. With steely eyes reflecting his absolute hatred of any kind of truth, he went with his old hits. He continued with his usual inane silliness about his election being fixed (confidentially, it was. Me and eighty of my co-conspirators each voted a million times), and without an iota of evidence claimed millions of recently released nuts from insane asylums are flooding into our country, What he didn't tell you, is they are all MAGA; where do you think these whackjobs come from?

Ah, but there is more -- so much more. With red-eyed malice and gibberish oozing from between his store-bought teeth, he continued to mouth other absurdities meant not for the general audience, but the dullards of MAGA.

He railed about immigrants eating Fluffy and Spot, he moaned about imaginary gangs of imaginary thugs (you know, like the insurrectionists of 1/6), he baselessly accused Nancy Pelosi of being in charge of security on 1/6, and he threatened to kill Obamacare, though he admitted he had no plan to replace it. He had apoplexy when it was pointed out masses of people abandon his rallies because of boredom. He rambled and gave a flustered response when asked why he killed the border bill his own party authored.

He claimed Harris was busing people to her rallies and paying them to be there. But, as usual, it was yet another lie meant to set the back-alley wanderers of MAGA's hair on fire.

Ah, but the highpoint of the evening actually came after the debate. The mega-MAGA-moron complained ABC fact checked him, essentially confirming he did unashamedly lie.

Trump is a criminal, a danger to our democracy, and he now confirms he's stupid, too.

247,1ff2j4i,Trump's lies and the dullards that believe them.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kamala/comments/1ff2j4i/trumps_lies_and_the_dullards_that_believe_them/,"Did ya' notice Trump and the MGA morons are whining about ABC fact-checking him, but make no mention of the fact he was, indeed, lying! And he wasn't just lying to the libs, he knows they would never believe him, no, he was lying to them because he believes they are dumb enough to believe anything he says.

He knows he can manipulate them, convince them of the most outrageous nonsense -- and leave them open to ridicule, mockery, and derision when they open their yaps and repeat the stupidity.

When will they learn he has no respect for them, that his former aides reported he laughs at them behind their backs. and he sees them only as tools or toilet tissue, to be used and then discarded?

Straighten up, MAGA, Yeah, he shares your disdain for blacks and immigrants, but is it worth the trade off?  Project 2025 will eliminate your freedoms. too.

When you walk into a room and it suddenly goes quiet, it should make manifest your spot in society.

Trump is an opportunist jackass, and he is leading down the road of the same 'jackassery'

So, believe the lies, repeat the lies, but pay attention to the scorn they elicit.",24,4,LetterGrouchy6053,Kamala,2024-09-12 13:26:10+00:00,0.86,/r/Kamala/comments/1ff2j4i/trumps_lies_and_the_dullards_that_believe_them/,False
