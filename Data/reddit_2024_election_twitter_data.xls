The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

Romney has made headlines in recent years for voting to remove former President Donald Trump from office and accusing fellow Republicans of stoking the January 6 insurrection.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

For the past eight years, I have reported extensively on national politics and Congress. I’ve traveled with Harris to Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Reno, Nevada, as well as to Africa, for my reporting.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

For the past eight years, I have reported extensively on national politics and Congress. I’ve traveled with Harris to Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Reno, Nevada, as well as to Africa, for my reporting.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

Trump continues to be the prohibitive favorite for the 2024 GOP nomination, clearing the field of all candidates except Nikki Haley, who has trailed him in the primaries so far. As political reporters for The Atlantic, we have covered his first presidency, his time out of office, his new campaign, his GOP opponents, and the Republican response to his continued domination over the party, both in Washington, D.C., and across the country.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role.

The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

For the past eight years, I have reported extensively on national politics and Congress. I’ve traveled with Harris to Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Reno, Nevada, as well as to Africa, for my reporting.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

Romney has made headlines in recent years for voting to remove former President Donald Trump from office and accusing fellow Republicans of stoking the January 6 insurrection.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

I’ve traveled with Harris to Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Reno, Nevada, as well as to Africa, for my reporting.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep.

He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep.

He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

Romney has made headlines in recent years for voting to remove former President Donald Trump from office and accusing fellow Republicans of stoking the January 6 insurrection.

My biography takes readers behind the scenes of Romney’s private meetings with Trump and dealings with Barack Obama, Joe Biden, George W. Bush, and more. I also detail his early life and his decision to ultimately retire from politics.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

For the past eight years, I have reported extensively on national politics and Congress. I’ve traveled with Harris to Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Reno, Nevada, as well as to Africa, for my reporting.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

The issue examines the effects of a possible second Trump term on the health of democracy, rule of law, corruption, foreign policy, immigration, extremism, science, climate, culture, journalism, and more. “Over time, the shock of Trump’s rhetoric has worn off,” David wrote in his essay, “making it easy to miss the fact that his message has grown even darker.”

Trump continues to be the prohibitive favorite for the 2024 GOP nomination, clearing the field of all candidates except Nikki Haley, who has trailed him in the primaries so far. As political reporters for The Atlantic, we have covered his first presidency, his time out of office, his new campaign, his GOP opponents, and the Republican response to his continued domination over the party, both in Washington, D.C., and across the country.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role.

The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

For the past eight years, I have reported extensively on national politics and Congress. I’ve traveled with Harris to Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Reno, Nevada, as well as to Africa, for my reporting.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

Romney has made headlines in recent years for voting to remove former President Donald Trump from office and accusing fellow Republicans of stoking the January 6 insurrection.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

I’ve traveled with Harris to Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Reno, Nevada, as well as to Africa, for my reporting.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep.

He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep.

He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

Romney has made headlines in recent years for voting to remove former President Donald Trump from office and accusing fellow Republicans of stoking the January 6 insurrection.

My biography takes readers behind the scenes of Romney’s private meetings with Trump and dealings with Barack Obama, Joe Biden, George W. Bush, and more. I also detail his early life and his decision to ultimately retire from politics.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

For the past eight years, I have reported extensively on national politics and Congress. I’ve traveled with Harris to Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Reno, Nevada, as well as to Africa, for my reporting.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

The issue examines the effects of a possible second Trump term on the health of democracy, rule of law, corruption, foreign policy, immigration, extremism, science, climate, culture, journalism, and more. “Over time, the shock of Trump’s rhetoric has worn off,” David wrote in his essay, “making it easy to miss the fact that his message has grown even darker.”

Trump continues to be the prohibitive favorite for the 2024 GOP nomination, clearing the field of all candidates except Nikki Haley, who has trailed him in the primaries so far. As political reporters for The Atlantic, we have covered his first presidency, his time out of office, his new campaign, his GOP opponents, and the Republican response to his continued domination over the party, both in Washington, D.C., and across the country.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role.

The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

For the past eight years, I have reported extensively on national politics and Congress. I’ve traveled with Harris to Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Reno, Nevada, as well as to Africa, for my reporting.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

Romney has made headlines in recent years for voting to remove former President Donald Trump from office and accusing fellow Republicans of stoking the January 6 insurrection.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

I’ve traveled with Harris to Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Reno, Nevada, as well as to Africa, for my reporting.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep.

He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep.

He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

Romney has made headlines in recent years for voting to remove former President Donald Trump from office and accusing fellow Republicans of stoking the January 6 insurrection.

My biography takes readers behind the scenes of Romney’s private meetings with Trump and dealings with Barack Obama, Joe Biden, George W. Bush, and more. I also detail his early life and his decision to ultimately retire from politics.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

For the past eight years, I have reported extensively on national politics and Congress. I’ve traveled with Harris to Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Reno, Nevada, as well as to Africa, for my reporting.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

The issue examines the effects of a possible second Trump term on the health of democracy, rule of law, corruption, foreign policy, immigration, extremism, science, climate, culture, journalism, and more. “Over time, the shock of Trump’s rhetoric has worn off,” David wrote in his essay, “making it easy to miss the fact that his message has grown even darker.”

Trump continues to be the prohibitive favorite for the 2024 GOP nomination, clearing the field of all candidates except Nikki Haley, who has trailed him in the primaries so far. As political reporters for The Atlantic, we have covered his first presidency, his time out of office, his new campaign, his GOP opponents, and the Republican response to his continued domination over the party, both in Washington, D.C., and across the country.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role.

The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

For the past eight years, I have reported extensively on national politics and Congress. I’ve traveled with Harris to Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Reno, Nevada, as well as to Africa, for my reporting.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

Romney has made headlines in recent years for voting to remove former President Donald Trump from office and accusing fellow Republicans of stoking the January 6 insurrection.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

I’ve traveled with Harris to Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Reno, Nevada, as well as to Africa, for my reporting.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep.

He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep.

He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

Romney has made headlines in recent years for voting to remove former President Donald Trump from office and accusing fellow Republicans of stoking the January 6 insurrection.

My biography takes readers behind the scenes of Romney’s private meetings with Trump and dealings with Barack Obama, Joe Biden, George W. Bush, and more. I also detail his early life and his decision to ultimately retire from politics.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

For the past eight years, I have reported extensively on national politics and Congress. I’ve traveled with Harris to Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Reno, Nevada, as well as to Africa, for my reporting.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

The issue examines the effects of a possible second Trump term on the health of democracy, rule of law, corruption, foreign policy, immigration, extremism, science, climate, culture, journalism, and more. “Over time, the shock of Trump’s rhetoric has worn off,” David wrote in his essay, “making it easy to miss the fact that his message has grown even darker.”

Trump continues to be the prohibitive favorite for the 2024 GOP nomination, clearing the field of all candidates except Nikki Haley, who has trailed him in the primaries so far. As political reporters for The Atlantic, we have covered his first presidency, his time out of office, his new campaign, his GOP opponents, and the Republican response to his continued domination over the party, both in Washington, D.C., and across the country.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role.

The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

For the past eight years, I have reported extensively on national politics and Congress. I’ve traveled with Harris to Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Reno, Nevada, as well as to Africa, for my reporting.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

Romney has made headlines in recent years for voting to remove former President Donald Trump from office and accusing fellow Republicans of stoking the January 6 insurrection.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

I’ve traveled with Harris to Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Reno, Nevada, as well as to Africa, for my reporting.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep.

He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep.

He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

Romney has made headlines in recent years for voting to remove former President Donald Trump from office and accusing fellow Republicans of stoking the January 6 insurrection.

My biography takes readers behind the scenes of Romney’s private meetings with Trump and dealings with Barack Obama, Joe Biden, George W. Bush, and more. I also detail his early life and his decision to ultimately retire from politics.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

For the past eight years, I have reported extensively on national politics and Congress. I’ve traveled with Harris to Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Reno, Nevada, as well as to Africa, for my reporting.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

The issue examines the effects of a possible second Trump term on the health of democracy, rule of law, corruption, foreign policy, immigration, extremism, science, climate, culture, journalism, and more. “Over time, the shock of Trump’s rhetoric has worn off,” David wrote in his essay, “making it easy to miss the fact that his message has grown even darker.”

Trump continues to be the prohibitive favorite for the 2024 GOP nomination, clearing the field of all candidates except Nikki Haley, who has trailed him in the primaries so far. As political reporters for The Atlantic, we have covered his first presidency, his time out of office, his new campaign, his GOP opponents, and the Republican response to his continued domination over the party, both in Washington, D.C., and across the country.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role.

The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

For the past eight years, I have reported extensively on national politics and Congress. I’ve traveled with Harris to Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Reno, Nevada, as well as to Africa, for my reporting.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

Romney has made headlines in recent years for voting to remove former President Donald Trump from office and accusing fellow Republicans of stoking the January 6 insurrection.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

I’ve traveled with Harris to Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Reno, Nevada, as well as to Africa, for my reporting.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep.

He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep.

He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

Romney has made headlines in recent years for voting to remove former President Donald Trump from office and accusing fellow Republicans of stoking the January 6 insurrection.

My biography takes readers behind the scenes of Romney’s private meetings with Trump and dealings with Barack Obama, Joe Biden, George W. Bush, and more. I also detail his early life and his decision to ultimately retire from politics.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

For the past eight years, I have reported extensively on national politics and Congress. I’ve traveled with Harris to Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Reno, Nevada, as well as to Africa, for my reporting.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

The issue examines the effects of a possible second Trump term on the health of democracy, rule of law, corruption, foreign policy, immigration, extremism, science, climate, culture, journalism, and more. “Over time, the shock of Trump’s rhetoric has worn off,” David wrote in his essay, “making it easy to miss the fact that his message has grown even darker.”

Trump continues to be the prohibitive favorite for the 2024 GOP nomination, clearing the field of all candidates except Nikki Haley, who has trailed him in the primaries so far. As political reporters for The Atlantic, we have covered his first presidency, his time out of office, his new campaign, his GOP opponents, and the Republican response to his continued domination over the party, both in Washington, D.C., and across the country.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role.

The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

For the past eight years, I have reported extensively on national politics and Congress. I’ve traveled with Harris to Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Reno, Nevada, as well as to Africa, for my reporting.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

Romney has made headlines in recent years for voting to remove former President Donald Trump from office and accusing fellow Republicans of stoking the January 6 insurrection.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

I’ve traveled with Harris to Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Reno, Nevada, as well as to Africa, for my reporting.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep.

He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep.

He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

Romney has made headlines in recent years for voting to remove former President Donald Trump from office and accusing fellow Republicans of stoking the January 6 insurrection.

My biography takes readers behind the scenes of Romney’s private meetings with Trump and dealings with Barack Obama, Joe Biden, George W. Bush, and more. I also detail his early life and his decision to ultimately retire from politics.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

For the past eight years, I have reported extensively on national politics and Congress. I’ve traveled with Harris to Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Reno, Nevada, as well as to Africa, for my reporting.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

The issue examines the effects of a possible second Trump term on the health of democracy, rule of law, corruption, foreign policy, immigration, extremism, science, climate, culture, journalism, and more. “Over time, the shock of Trump’s rhetoric has worn off,” David wrote in his essay, “making it easy to miss the fact that his message has grown even darker.”

Trump continues to be the prohibitive favorite for the 2024 GOP nomination, clearing the field of all candidates except Nikki Haley, who has trailed him in the primaries so far. As political reporters for The Atlantic, we have covered his first presidency, his time out of office, his new campaign, his GOP opponents, and the Republican response to his continued domination over the party, both in Washington, D.C., and across the country.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role.

The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

For the past eight years, I have reported extensively on national politics and Congress. I’ve traveled with Harris to Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Reno, Nevada, as well as to Africa, for my reporting.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

Romney has made headlines in recent years for voting to remove former President Donald Trump from office and accusing fellow Republicans of stoking the January 6 insurrection.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

I’ve traveled with Harris to Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Reno, Nevada, as well as to Africa, for my reporting.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep.

He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep.

He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

Romney has made headlines in recent years for voting to remove former President Donald Trump from office and accusing fellow Republicans of stoking the January 6 insurrection.

My biography takes readers behind the scenes of Romney’s private meetings with Trump and dealings with Barack Obama, Joe Biden, George W. Bush, and more. I also detail his early life and his decision to ultimately retire from politics.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

For the past eight years, I have reported extensively on national politics and Congress. I’ve traveled with Harris to Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Reno, Nevada, as well as to Africa, for my reporting.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

The issue examines the effects of a possible second Trump term on the health of democracy, rule of law, corruption, foreign policy, immigration, extremism, science, climate, culture, journalism, and more. “Over time, the shock of Trump’s rhetoric has worn off,” David wrote in his essay, “making it easy to miss the fact that his message has grown even darker.”

Trump continues to be the prohibitive favorite for the 2024 GOP nomination, clearing the field of all candidates except Nikki Haley, who has trailed him in the primaries so far. As political reporters for The Atlantic, we have covered his first presidency, his time out of office, his new campaign, his GOP opponents, and the Republican response to his continued domination over the party, both in Washington, D.C., and across the country.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role.

The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

For the past eight years, I have reported extensively on national politics and Congress. I’ve traveled with Harris to Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Reno, Nevada, as well as to Africa, for my reporting.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

Romney has made headlines in recent years for voting to remove former President Donald Trump from office and accusing fellow Republicans of stoking the January 6 insurrection.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

I’ve traveled with Harris to Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Reno, Nevada, as well as to Africa, for my reporting.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep.

He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep.

He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

Romney has made headlines in recent years for voting to remove former President Donald Trump from office and accusing fellow Republicans of stoking the January 6 insurrection.

My biography takes readers behind the scenes of Romney’s private meetings with Trump and dealings with Barack Obama, Joe Biden, George W. Bush, and more. I also detail his early life and his decision to ultimately retire from politics.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

For the past eight years, I have reported extensively on national politics and Congress. I’ve traveled with Harris to Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Reno, Nevada, as well as to Africa, for my reporting.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

The issue examines the effects of a possible second Trump term on the health of democracy, rule of law, corruption, foreign policy, immigration, extremism, science, climate, culture, journalism, and more. “Over time, the shock of Trump’s rhetoric has worn off,” David wrote in his essay, “making it easy to miss the fact that his message has grown even darker.”

Trump continues to be the prohibitive favorite for the 2024 GOP nomination, clearing the field of all candidates except Nikki Haley, who has trailed him in the primaries so far. As political reporters for The Atlantic, we have covered his first presidency, his time out of office, his new campaign, his GOP opponents, and the Republican response to his continued domination over the party, both in Washington, D.C., and across the country.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role.

The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

For the past eight years, I have reported extensively on national politics and Congress. I’ve traveled with Harris to Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Reno, Nevada, as well as to Africa, for my reporting.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

Romney has made headlines in recent years for voting to remove former President Donald Trump from office and accusing fellow Republicans of stoking the January 6 insurrection.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

I’ve traveled with Harris to Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Reno, Nevada, as well as to Africa, for my reporting.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep.

He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep.

He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

Romney has made headlines in recent years for voting to remove former President Donald Trump from office and accusing fellow Republicans of stoking the January 6 insurrection.

My biography takes readers behind the scenes of Romney’s private meetings with Trump and dealings with Barack Obama, Joe Biden, George W. Bush, and more. I also detail his early life and his decision to ultimately retire from politics.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

For the past eight years, I have reported extensively on national politics and Congress. I’ve traveled with Harris to Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Reno, Nevada, as well as to Africa, for my reporting.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

The issue examines the effects of a possible second Trump term on the health of democracy, rule of law, corruption, foreign policy, immigration, extremism, science, climate, culture, journalism, and more. “Over time, the shock of Trump’s rhetoric has worn off,” David wrote in his essay, “making it easy to miss the fact that his message has grown even darker.”

Trump continues to be the prohibitive favorite for the 2024 GOP nomination, clearing the field of all candidates except Nikki Haley, who has trailed him in the primaries so far. As political reporters for The Atlantic, we have covered his first presidency, his time out of office, his new campaign, his GOP opponents, and the Republican response to his continued domination over the party, both in Washington, D.C., and across the country.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role.

The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

For the past eight years, I have reported extensively on national politics and Congress. I’ve traveled with Harris to Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Reno, Nevada, as well as to Africa, for my reporting.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

Romney has made headlines in recent years for voting to remove former President Donald Trump from office and accusing fellow Republicans of stoking the January 6 insurrection.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

I’ve traveled with Harris to Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Reno, Nevada, as well as to Africa, for my reporting.

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep.

He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election.

We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep.

He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026.

I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution.

Until next time!**

Hi, folks! We’re [Alex Samuels,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/) [Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/) and [Nathaniel Rakich,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/) and we’re members of the politics team at FiveThirtyEight. The 2024 presidential primary is heating up, and we’ll be here from **3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET** today to answer as many questions as we can about it. We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

For your bookmarks: We’re tracking favorability ratings for major presidential candidates [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-pence-election-polls/), and Biden’s approval rating [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/).

Update: Finishing up edits on a story — will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

We’ll sign our individual responses with our initials. 

Here’s a glimpse of what we’ve been thinking about lately: 

How will former President Donald Trump’s indictment affect his chances of regaining the presidency? [According to recent polling,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-indictment-might-be-making-him-more-popular-among-republicans/) Americans seem to believe in the abstract that paying hush money to cover up an affair and then covering up the payment itself is probably bad, but may disagree about whether Trump actually did it and whether he should go to jail for it.

Should anti-Trump Republicans [clear the field](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-desantis-2024-primary/) for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?

Could President Biden’s [move toward the political center,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-is-biden-moving-to-the-political-center/) particularly [on immigration,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-moving-right-on-immigration-will-that-hurt-him-in-2024/) be intended to improve his chances in 2024? 

Some polling from earlier in the year suggested that Democrats aren’t thrilled with the idea of having [Biden as their nominee again.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-2024-marianne-williamson/) According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, only 31 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the party to renominate Biden, while 58 percent said they’d prefer someone else. So then why haven’t any big-name Democrats stepped up to challenge him?

[DeSantis is doubling down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/) on conservative crusades over education, LGBTQ rights and more. Will it help or hurt his chances for getting elected president in 2024?

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

The issue examines the effects of a possible second Trump term on the health of democracy, rule of law, corruption, foreign policy, immigration, extremism, science, climate, culture, journalism, and more. “Over time, the shock of Trump’s rhetoric has worn off,” David wrote in his essay, “making it easy to miss the fact that his message has grown even darker.”

Trump continues to be the prohibitive favorite for the 2024 GOP nomination, clearing the field of all candidates except Nikki Haley, who has trailed him in the primaries so far. As political reporters for The Atlantic, we have covered his first presidency, his time out of office, his new campaign, his GOP opponents, and the Republican response to his continued domination over the party, both in Washington, D.C., and across the country.

Romney has made headlines in recent years for voting to remove former President Donald Trump from office and accusing fellow Republicans of stoking the January 6 insurrection.

Based on hundreds of pages of personal journals that he gave me, along with dozens of interviews with him and his inner circle, I trace Romney’s rise through the Republican Party. My biography takes readers behind the scenes of Romney’s private meetings with Trump and dealings with Barack Obama, Joe Biden, George W. Bush, and more. I also detail his early life and his decision to ultimately retire from politics.

I have reported extensively on American politics for more than a decade.

"I’m Elaina Plott Calabro, a staff writer at The Atlantic. I profiled Kamala Harris for our November issue.

The possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most U.S. elections during the past half century. But given President Joe Biden’s age, many are wondering if Harris is prepared for the presidency—and few people seem to believe she is. I explain through my reporting what they’re missing.

For the past eight years, I have reported extensively on national politics and Congress. I’ve traveled with Harris to Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Reno, Nevada, as well as to Africa, for my reporting. You can read my story [here](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/11/kamala-harris-vice-presidency-2024-election-biden-age/675439/) and an interview about writing this feature [here](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/10/kamala-harris-narrative/675616/).

"I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal. I write a lot about the IRS and the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. Ask me anything.",https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/11h5w5a/im_richard_rubin_a_us_tax_policy_reporter_for_the/,https://twitter.com/RichardRubinDC/status/1630245676427927552,"**Update: Thanks everyone for the great questions. I have to run now, but if there's more on tax policy that you're still curious about, you can find my email on my WSJ author page [here](https://www.wsj.com/news/author/richard-rubin). I answer every reader question I get!**

The IRS is [on the cusp of an $80 billion transformation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/danny-werfel-poised-to-return-to-irs-and-lead-its-80-billion-transformation-11672527665?st=lce2nxyiobb9dvp), and is the focus of roiling political debates over its size and role. [Daniel Werfel will likely be appointed IRS commissioner. His confirmation hearing in February centered his plans for the new funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pick-for-irs-chief-to-face-questions-about-agencys-80-billion-expansion-9f17e507?st=10el4o704wpq34s) Over the next decade, the IRS plans to increase tax enforcement on high-income households and large corporations. The agency will also work to modernize its aging technology and improve communication with taxpayers.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders [have chosen Rep. Jason Smith](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-jason-smith-picked-to-lead-house-ways-and-means-committee-11673298887?st=jkikim6wh997hoe) (R., Mo.) to run the House Ways and Means Committee. He’ll have the opportunity to shape U.S. tax policy, and vows to conduct tough oversight over the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Smith will also have the opportunity to shape the Republican Party’s direction and message on top tax issues as the party tries to expand its support among working-class households. 

[That focus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-gop-tax-legislator-says-hell-boost-workers-probe-companies-11675695374?st=jqmfxqbse28fmja) could make it harder for corporations to draw attention to their tax-policy goals, such as trying to revive recently expired tax breaks or blocking tax increases on multinational companies that are scheduled to start in 2026. 

I’m Richard Rubin, a U.S. tax policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Washington. My work focuses on the intersection of taxes, legislation, politics and economics. I've been reporting on how U.S. tax policy might be shaped by the new leadership and what the political turmoil over the future of the IRS means for the institution. I’m also watching how both parties position themselves on tax policy heading into the 2024 election. 

Ask me anything.
