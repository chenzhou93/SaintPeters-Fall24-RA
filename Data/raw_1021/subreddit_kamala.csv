Here's this script:

An inexperienced young male boxer hitting pads for the first time.

**Narrator**

“If you start boxing today, would you expect to win a world title this year?”

*The boxer spars and loses badly.*

**Narrator**

“Would you expect to dominate without experience?”

*The boxer ditches practices to go drinking with his friends.*

**Narrator**

“Would you expect to win without showing up?”

*Cut to a picture of Donald Trump.*

**Narrator**

“So why would you believe that Donald Trump created the world’s greatest economy in less than a year? When he had no idea what he was doing?”

*Cut to a relevant picture, infographic, or headline.*

**Narrator**

“When his tax plan added five trillion to our national debt?”

*Cut to another relevant picture, infographic, or headline.*

**Narrator**

“When he pulled us out of trade deals that ultimately pushed our partners toward China?”

*Cut to another relevant picture, infographic or headline.*

**Narrator**

“Was our pre-Covid economy really built by Trump?”

*Cut back to the young boxer, working harder on the pads.*

**Narrator**

“Or was it built by years of boring fundamentals?”

*Cut to Obama talking with citizens.*

**Narrator**

“Years of investments to infrastructure, education, and the American people?”

*Cut to Kamala shaking hands with world leaders.*

**Narrator**

“Years of building American trust around the world?”

*Back to the boxer training.*

**Narrator**

“Good things take time. And we aren’t going back.”

Message: Vote Kamala Harris.

END SCRIPT.

**Why will this ad work?**

1. Boxing appeals to masculine men. For masculine men, peer pressure to support Trump is very intense. Using a story relatable to masculine men can relieve some of that pressure, causing many would-be Trump voters to stay home.
2. Uses an emotional, unexpected, and engaging analogy to drive home the point: Trump doesn’t deserve credit for the strong pre-Covid economy.
3. Encourages smart independents to take a closer look into the details, revealing major holes in Trump’s economic claims.
4. Gives concrete examples of Trump’s policy failures, challenging a common Trump-voter rhetoric: “I vote on policy, not scandal.”
5. Even if Kamala loses, this ad will plant seeds for the future in case Trump takes credit for Biden’s economic momentum.",5,1,JimmyGreyArea,Kamala,2024-10-10 09:15:57+00:00,0.77,/r/Kamala/comments/1g0ep9x/i_have_a_winning_kamala_campaign_commercial/,False

1fsve1w,Feeling so disheartened ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kamala/comments/1fsve1w/feeling_so_disheartened/,"Sorry for the long post. I live in Florida and ordered two Harris Walz signs weeks ago. They finally arrive. I put one up and gave the other sign to my neighbor. 

A mere two days later I had a package delivered and needed to sign for it. The guy starts talking about my Harris sign. ""I see you have the sign up. Did you hear they are flying in missles to assassinate Trump"" I'm like ""oh I didnt hear that. That's awful. "" 

I was polite bc I'm alone at home. As a woman I know better than to put him in his place for talking about politics while on the job in a uniform.  He finishes the conversation by saying ""there's a lot of crazy people out there"" three times while looking at my sign and looking back at me. I felt threatened and so I took my sign down. My neighbor tells me he will not take his sign down and that it's bs to be intimidated by this guy. He's right. Two days later my neighbors yard sign is stolen. 

I'm so angry at the trump supporters in my area. I've spent years looking at trump signs in my neighborhood. I have never said anything rude or taken a sign down. I'm going to buy another for my neighbor and keep replacing them. 

I just want to discuss this with other people who may have had something similar happen to them.  Thanks for reading.

1fp7eoc,Increasing support from young male voters ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kamala/comments/1fp7eoc/increasing_support_from_young_male_voters/,"I've been thinking a lot about the disconnect between young male voters and Kamala Harris' campaign. These voters are new to politics, they may be less informed, and often they are not as wealthy as the typical Reddit user. Many among them we simply cannot reach, however the one's we can reach, have some really important characteristics:

1. They love their mothers, sisters, aunts, wives/girlfriends. The women in their lives are important to them.

2. When they hear lies like ""after birth abortion"" they don't know how to respond. They might agree in the moment just because they don't know. However, if we talk to them with empathy, they will listen.

3. They are still figuring out what what kind of men they want to be. This is going to be a long process for them.

So what can we do about it?

I think we need to remind them of that love they hold for the women in their lives. Remind them of how much they care and how far they willing to go to protect the women they care about.

As for political lies, we can keep presenting them with clear facts about abortion, women's health care, and reproductive needs. We can also work to better provide real time fact checking to political lies as they happen. Don't let the lies breathe, counter them on the spot.

As for examples, we can lean more into Tim Walz. As a veteran, husband, and father, he will appeal to their own images of themselves while demonstrating what it means to be a man who supports Kamala Harris. We can also bring in more Gen X and older men are presenting similar examples.

These men need role models, us men who support Kamala Harris can be those role models.

In 1939 Hitler spread the stench of tyranny in Poland, now fascist sheriff Bruce Zuchowski is doing the same here at home.

Taking a leaf from Trump's MAGA Manifesto, Project 2025, to wit:

""decimate privacy protections for anyone other than U.S. citizens and green card holders. This allows for the weaponization of information-sharing that exposes names, birthdates, addresses, and photographs of individuals encountered at the border and nearly any other foreign national, including children and legally present visa holders, thereby exposing them to potential harm, harassment, or discrimination. \[139\] \[165\]8\]

...create a show-me-your-papers style mandate and task ICE Deportation Officers with removing, arresting, and detaining immigration violators anywhere in the United States, without warrant where appropriate. This would lead to increased racial profiling and discrimination against Latinos, immigrants and other people of color. \[142\]

he has asked his radicalized supporters to help him compile a list of those who MAGA considers to be at odds with their white nationalist xenophobia, so a record will exist of those who will be subject to retribution when he is reelected.

Sinclair Lewis foretold of this in his 1935 dystopian novel, ""It can't happen Here'.

It can happen here -- it is happening here!

Ben Wolford·September 16, 2024·

Portage County Sheriff Bruce Zuchowski seemed to encourage his friends and supporters to **write down th**e **addresses of people with Democratic yard signs,** sparking accusations of voter intimidation. In identical posts to his personal and public Facebook accounts on Sept. 13, Zuchowski wrote what he claims to tell people who ask him what will happen if Vice President Kamala Harris wins the presidential election. **Using dehumanizing language, he says he tells them to record the addresses of people with Harris yard signs** in order to house immigrants with them.

**“When people ask me…What’s gonna happen if the Flip – Flopping, Laughing Hyena Wins?? I say…write down all the addresses of the people who had her signs in their yards!** Sooo…when the Illegal human “Locust” (which she supports!) Need places to live…We’ll already have the addresses of the their New families…who supported their arrival!” the posts stated, along with accompanying pictures of a television tuned to Fox News. 

**In the comments under the post on his personal Facebook page, one supporter replied with the name and street of someone with a Harris sign. “I’ll add that name to the list,” another replied. Someone else commented, “Making a list and checking it twice.” As of Sept. 15, that post had hundreds of reactions and over 100 shares.**

Despite numerous lies by him that he has no knowledge of the multi-restrictive legislative proposals, voters know better than to believe anything he says.

""If his mouth is open, he's lying"" is a commonly repeated refrain.

Project 2025 will undo centuries of governmental design, replace experts in management and organization with hand picked stooges with no expertise other than in fawning over their tin God.

Remember 'Brownie,' the Bush appointee who couldn't even get water delivered to the suffering New Orleans masses after Katrina? Picture 50,000 inept clones.

Project 2025 will, among other things, institute a national ban on abortion, extremely curtail veteran rights, reduce Social Security benefits, eliminate overtime pay, eliminate Obamacare and provide no alternative, politicize the Justice Department so only hand-picked criminals will be prosecuted while corporations and crooked politicians walk free, and this is just the beginning of the travesties the dictator will implement on day one!

Here's an interactive site that will answer all your questions about this extreme measure; [https://www.25and.me/?topics=](https://www.25and.me/?topics=)

Here are poll results indicating just how much Americans fear project 2025 and its implementation by a Republican victory in the fall.:

Matt Canter, a pollster from Global Strategy Group, on Wednesday briefed Democratic campaign staffers, political consultants, advocacy organizations and journalists about a poll conducted from Aug. 22 to Aug. 28 in 27 states, focusing on 63 ""battleground"" congressional districts up for grabs in November's election.

Canter said Project 2025 ""has penetrated the electorate in a very difficult and noisy environment.""

And that's bad news for Trump and Republicans running down ballot from him for congressional seats. The poll touched on congressional districts in six swing states – Arizona, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – expected to determine who wins the presidency. The poll was sponsored by the advocacy groups End Citizens United, Third Way and MoveOn as a road map for making sure Project 2025 doesn't just stick to Trump but also gets linked to Republicans seeking House seats.

Canter called that ""an exciting opportunity to play offense.""

""Nearly two-thirds of voters report hearing or seeing something about Project 2025, and the disdain runs deep,"" he said. ""And it's not just Democratic base voters driving animosity. We see a majority of the swing voters that have heard are familiar with Project 2025 are deeply unfavorable as well.""

Vance has an agenda of his own. The MAGA movement, unaware of the suppression of rights and liberties already outlined in Trump's MAGA Manifesto, Project 2025, is fertile ground for a new, even more extremist movement that will require every citizen to adhere to principles Margret Atwood never dreamed of.

If J.D. isn't already bat-shit loony enough, it has now been revealed his real motivation is to subsume the MAGA movement and turn it into a hyper religious sect based on ultra-orthodox Catholic zealotry so far to the right Father Coughlin would repudiate it.

He is smiling and outwardly supporting Trump, but this snake-in-the grass Judas has blinded Trump with so much flattery and fawning faux admiration the Orange Man can't see the deviousness through the acclaim.

Check this out -- boldface mine.



Sofia Nelson, a lawyer and former Yale Law School classmate of Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance, warned on Saturday that the Ohio senator is working to **""hijack"" former President Donald Trump's Make America Great Again (MAGA**) movement in favor of a far more rigid and **orthodox theocracy called post-liberalism.** In op-ed for MSNBC published Saturday morning, Nelson said that the post-liberal movement, unlike MAGA, seeks to replace existing social and political power structures with orde**rs rooted in conservative Catholic social teachings.**

Nelson contends that post-liberalists, like Vance, seek to position themselves within the MAGA movement with the aim of inheriting **Trump's political base** once he leaves politics. Their goal is to turn the **GOP into a pro-theocracy party,** Nelson said. The op-ed warns about the danger of a post-liberal rise and the need to counteract it, not just for the sake of defeating Trump, but to maintain the democratic values underpinning U.S. society.

""There is some policy overlap between MAGA and post-liberalism in their shared opposition, for example, to immigration and transgender rights. But the ideological overlap between the groups is a shared affinity for authoritarianism,"" Nelson wrote. **""The post-liberal right, which has goals that even MAGA Republicans would find extreme, is attempting to hijack the MAGA** movement to push its own agenda.""

Nelson befriended Vance and his wife, Usha Vance, while they were attending Yale Law School. Nelson, who is transgender and uses they/them pronouns, had a falling out with **JD Vance** when he launched his political career and backed bans on transgender minors receiving gender-affirming care. They told CNN's Erin Burnett in July that the senator's shift in opinions were motivated by his **ambition for ""political power and wealth.""**

In the op-ed, Nelson pointed to Vance's alleged influences within the post-liberal movement.

""Despite the time we spent as friends, I have no real insights (other than **political expediency)** into what drew him to post-liberal men like the academic Patrick Deneen, columnist Sohrab Ahmari, legal scholar Adrian Vermeule and expat journalist and author Rod Dreher, who was present for **Vance's baptism into the Catholic Church in 2019,""** Nelson wrote. ""What I do know is that **Vance used to condemn Trump's racism a**nd be empathetic to how such rhetoric made Americans feel unwelcome in their own country. But these men have had an obvious and heartbreaking effect on Vance's worldview.""

**Nelson said Vance's ""obsession""** with birth rates and his remarks about childless women reflect his post-liberal belief structure. They also point out that Vance's comments in favor of eliminating ""no-fault divorce"" drifts further to the right on marriage issues than what is contained in **The Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 initiative,** a political movement led by conservative think tanks that aim to shape the next Republican administration's policies.

Trump has repeatedly denied having any relation to **Project 2025,** but many of its contributors are former members of his administration, and his own platform, called **Agenda 47, shares broad policy similarities on several issues.**

1fgjsqg,"MAGA, you think it's funny..?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kamala/comments/1fgjsqg/maga_you_think_its_funny/,"# So, MAGA, you think it's hilarious when Trump and Vance say something moronic. If you were smart enough to look over Trump's MAGA Manifest, Project 2025, you would soon change your mind. The draconian cuts to all benefits and services will not only effect Libs and Dems, but every American citizen including you, and especially those who rely on social services, unemployment insurance, and veteran benefits.

And you giggle when he and Vance stick it to the immigrants by making outlandish charges. Well, look where it leads. Your kids go to the threatened schools, too. Sure, so far the cowardly bomb threats and assassinations in Springfield, Ohio, have been as false as Trump's promises, but when will that change? Face it, thus far nearly every shooter has been from a heavily armed family -- and they aren't Democrats.

When will one of you red-eyed, malignant MAGA morons, go overboard on the provocative lies and actually make good on the threats. You know who I mean, the ones already on the edge -- the disaffected and disturbed -- those who require only a little more goading and incitement to believe, like the Insurgents of 1/6, that he is following out Trump's orders.

Those will be your kids getting shredded with the rest.

See below if you have the courage -- boldface mine.

**For the second day in a row,** elementary school children in Springfield, Ohio, were forced to be **due to threats: a bomb threat on Thursday and an unspecified threat on Friday.** The threats come after **Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio U.S. Senator JD Vance,** have repeatedly **spread lies** about Haitian immigrants in Springfield this week, including that they are **stealing residents’ cats and dogs and eating them.**

Thursday’s **bomb threat specifically mentioned the false claims** about Haitian immigrants eating people’s pets, USA Today reported.

“Three schools in Springfield were evacuated or closed Friday, based on guidance from police, school officials said,” local NBC affiliate WLWT reports. “Officials with the Springfield City School District said that based on information they got from the Springfield Police Division, **students at Perrin Woods and Snowhill Elementary were evacuated** and moved to another district location.”

A Springfield middle school was also ordered closed Friday morning, before classes began, and “at least one Springfield location of the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles is closed.”

On Thursday, a **bomb threat targeting Springfield city hall** and an elementary school forced evacuations of those buildings.

“Police Chief Allison Elliott said that due to the

officials evacuated multiple buildings in addition to City Hall, including BMV Springfield Driver’s Exam Station, Ohio License Bureau Southside, Springfield Academy of Excellence and Fulton Elementary School.”

Despite the reports of the bomb threat on Thursday, hours late**r Donald Trump** used his Truth Social platform to promote the Republican nominee working to unseat Democratic U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, by **spreading more anti-Haitian immigrant racism.**

There's ore, much more:

Glowering like a puppy about to be eaten by an immigrant, Trump made a bigger jackass out of himself than he usually does. With steely eyes reflecting his absolute hatred of any kind of truth, he went with his old hits. He continued with his usual inane silliness about his election being fixed (confidentially, it was. Me and eighty of my co-conspirators each voted a million times), and without an iota of evidence claimed millions of recently released nuts from insane asylums are flooding into our country, What he didn't tell you, is they are all MAGA; where do you think these whackjobs come from?

Ah, but there is more -- so much more. With red-eyed malice and gibberish oozing from between his store-bought teeth, he continued to mouth other absurdities meant not for the general audience, but the dullards of MAGA.

He railed about immigrants eating Fluffy and Spot, he moaned about imaginary gangs of imaginary thugs (you know, like the insurrectionists of 1/6), he baselessly accused Nancy Pelosi of being in charge of security on 1/6, and he threatened to kill Obamacare, though he admitted he had no plan to replace it. He had apoplexy when it was pointed out masses of people abandon his rallies because of boredom. He rambled and gave a flustered response when asked why he killed the border bill his own party authored.

He claimed Harris was busing people to her rallies and paying them to be there. But, as usual, it was yet another lie meant to set the back-alley wanderers of MAGA's hair on fire.

Ah, but the highpoint of the evening actually came after the debate. The mega-MAGA-moron complained ABC fact checked him, essentially confirming he did unashamedly lie.

Trump is a criminal, a danger to our democracy, and he now confirms he's stupid, too.

1fe7rj9,Twenty-five percent of Republicans think Trump should seize power even if he loses.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kamala/comments/1fe7rj9/twentyfive_percent_of_republicans_think_trump/,"

# This is the current state of the union. Democracy is at death's door and your freedoms and rights hold no significance to the rabid cabal that has subsumed the GOP.

Trump's MAGA Manifesto, Project 2025, has so inflamed the passions of the red-eyed zealots and drooling racists -- the haters, the white supremacists, and the adherents to a bastardized form of Christianity -- they will eagerly disenfranchise over eighty-million of their countrymen, and set aside the legitimate vote to install a convicted felon and sex offender they wouldn't trust with their seventeen-year-old daughter.

Make no mistake, this is the findings of a legitimate news organization. The results clearly show this under-class of the disaffected, disgruntled malcontents will strip us of our Constitutional rights and imprison all dissenters as if this was a third world country firmly in the grasp of an evil dictatorship.

Because that is what they are aiming at, a dictatorship of the vile, the uneducated, and the smarmy dregs of bitter streets who know no success other than can be gained by violence and chaos.

Face it, you know MAGA, you have some of them in your family and social circle. You know they are bereft of compassion, vicious in the defense of their irrationality, and will fervently succumb to the temptations of absolute power in their lust for the acceptance they could never attain in any other manner.

America is at a crossroad, the final inflection point, and its fate awaits. Freedom and democracy, or dictatorship and slavery -- your vote will decide which.

Trump falsely claims children being forced into gender transition ops at school in rambling fantasy-filled rally speech

Former president slammed for suggesting children are subjected to ‘brutal’ gender operations at schools as he ignores gun violence

Gustaf Kilander

Donald Trump falsely claimed yet again that children are the subject of “brutal” gender operations at schools across the US. “Kamala supports states being able to take minor children and perform sex change operations, take them away from their parents, perform sex change operations, and send them back home,” Trump said in Mosinee, Wisconsin on Saturday afternoon.

“Can you imagine you’re a parent and your son leaves the house and you say, ‘Jimmy, I love you so much. Go have a good day in school’ and your son comes back with a brutal operation,” he added. “Can you even imagine this? What the hell is wrong with our country?”

There’s no evidence this has ever happened or been planned. In states where gender-affirming surgery is legal for people under the age of 18, parental consent is required. Trump made a similar false claim while speaking to the conservative group Moms for Liberty last week.

“The transgender thing is incredible. Think of it. Your kid goes to school and comes home a few days later with an operation. The school decides what’s going to happen with your child,” he falsely claimed.

An adolescent medicine physician at the Yale School of Medicine, Dr Meredith McNamara, told CNN on Monday that “everything in this statement is false.”

“Of course, surgery of any kind happens in a qualified medical center and not in a school. Of course, parents are the medical decision-makers for their kids, especially when it comes to gender-affirming care,” she added.

Pediatrician Michael O’Brien reacted to Trump’s rally speech on Saturday night, writing on X: “I cannot overstate this… if you are afraid that your child is going to have a gender-affirming surgery at school but you aren’t afraid they may be shot at school, there is no way we’re living in the same nation.”

“Can you imagine you’re a parent and your son leaves the house, and you say, ‘Jimmy, I love you so much. Go have a good day in school’ and your son doesn’t come back because of a guy armed with an AR-15? Because that actually happens, all across this country,” actor George Takei wrote.

# Trump's MAGA Manifesto, Project 2025. demands that veterans' benefits be cut by limiting after-care for service-related injury. No matter the cause, no matter the ramifications of that injury, care will be provided only for the initial cause, and any follow up damage will be the injured serviceman's responsibility.

Beyond that, Col. Rep Lauren Boebert failed to support expanded benefits for those who were exposed to toxins during the course of their service.

Remember 'Tommy' by Rudyard Kipling?

'For its Tommy this an;

Tommy that, and chuck him

out, the brute, but its

'Savior of the country'

when the guns begin to shoot.""

Different era, but same unappreciative sentiment.

See this -- boldface mine.

(The Hill) — Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) **defended her vote against bipartisan legislation that** expanded health benefits for veterans, saying Tuesday she didn’t want to spend “$600 billion forever.”

Boebert faced off in a general election debate against her Democratic opponent, Trisha Calvarese. The Democrat pressed Boebert to explain why she didn’t support the landmark “Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act,” **which expanded benefits for millions of veterans** who were exposed to toxins during service and are suffering illnesses as a result. “If you’re going to take care of folks, what about our veterans, Lauren? You know, because you’re talking about lots of cuts and how to pay for things. I think if you’re going to be America first, **you can’t put veterans last,”** Calvarese said to Boebert during the lunchtime debate in Colorado’s 4th Congressional District.

“I do just want to point to your vote that — **you voted against care for veterans exposed to cancer-causing toxins and burn pits** during war,” Calvarese added.

Boebert responded, saying, “When it comes to our veterans. I have absolutely put them first. In my first year, we were in the minority, and unfortunately not all the legislation was great.”

**The Republican said she voted agains**t some massive omnibus bills that might have supported veterans, because “I’m not voting for something that we have 22 hours to read that’s over 2,000 pages long.”

The House and Senate each passed the PACT Act in July 2022, and **Biden signed it into law** a short time later. All Democrats and a majority of Republicans in both chambers voted for the legislation. **Boebert was one of 88 House Republicans who voted against it.**

The legislation expands eligibility for Department of Veterans Affairs health care to veterans who served in the post-9/11 era and creates a framework for **establishing presumptions of service connections related to toxic exposures.** The bill also expands presumptions for 23 burn pit-related illnesses.

When Boebert then mentioned other work she’s done to help veterans, Calvarese said, “The folks in this room are not — they’re not foolish.” **Boebert cut in, saying, “I’m not spending $600 billion** forever because we couldn’t get a couple pieces of language right in legislation. Just because a bill is on the floor does not make it the only option. “I fought so we could have amendments on the House floor. When that bill first came up, I was in the minority, and amendments were closed on the House floor. I could not give a Colorado voice to the men and women who have served in our military on that legislation.”

Before the PACT Act was signed, some Republicans objected to its $400 billion mandatory spending, which would not have been subject to annual appropriations review. After facing tremendous public pressure — including from high-profile allies such as comedian Jon Stewart, who joined veterans camped out on the U.S. Capitol steps — the Senate agreed to three cost-controlling amendments on the bill, which led a number of Republicans to back it. **Eleven Republican senators still voted against it.**

The Hill has contacted the Boebert campaign for comment.

They know no other country, profess allegiance to no other country, and are as American as any native-born citizen.

Their parents came here seeking only safety for them. Seeking escape from the horrors, the depredations, and injustices of their native lands, and to provide access to the American dream; a good education and the promise of a happy and secure life for their children,

While the parents labored at jobs Americans had no taste for and paid their taxes -- and committed fewer crimes than their native-born neighbors -- the children thrived. Many of them served in the armed forces, vowing to give their lives in service to the country had given them so much.

All 1.6 million of them.

Now Trump and his Republican panderers are making a vow of their own. Not a vow that recognizes the greatness and compassion of our country, but one that promises 'Bloody' retribution as red meat for the rabid and red-eyed racist white supremacists fouling our national being.

Trump has already promised to incarcerate his political opponents, that is where he hasn't openly called for their execution, He has advocated for the murder of some of his own military staff when they disagreed with him, and now says he intends to use any method necessary- including unmitigated violence -- to deport a huge portion of our country.

The irony is, Trump doesn't give a damn about immigration. If he cared he never would have forced the scum in the House to vote down their own bill to improve things at the border, No, he finds it a useful tool to keep MAGA hair on fire,

Here is Trumps promise in his own words: ""And ya know getting them out will be a bloody story,"" Trump told supporters on Saturday, referencing plans for large-scale removal of undocumented immigrants. ""\[They\] should have never been allowed to come into our country. Nobody checked them.""

While House MAGA Republicans waste the country's money on phony hearings and investigations (Rumor is they will propose a *new* law to prevent citizens from removing tags from mattresses), the Democrats in the House and Senate are doing real work to make the lives of citizens better.

We all know the administration in a truly lifesaving move, capped the price of insulin for senior citizens at 35.00 and is working to keep the price at that level for all Americans, They have reduced prescription prices, and rescued the country and changed the course of the pandemic. If you remember Trump tried to downplay the horrors of Covid by saying it was 'King Flu', a' Democrat hoax' a 'Chinese hoax', all the while tens of thousands of Americans were needlessly dying. The Democrats also provided untold billions of dollars for infrastructure repair for every state in the union.

You see those roads and highways being repaired? That isn't local money, that is your federal tax dollars being returned to you

Speaking of tax dollars, the IRS has just reported collecting 1.3 billion dollars from mega-millionaires who, under the previous Republican administration were able to dodge their responsibility.

We have to pay taxes, why not the people who are already obscenely wealthy?

If you recall the Republicans fought like hell against increasing IRS funding. They lied through their store bought teeth telling us the money would be used to go after low income earners, when the exact opposite is true.

Millionaires, billionaires, and the tax-dodging corporations have been put on notice, pay up or go to prison.

Now they are paying up.

See below -- boldface mine.

.© Tasos Katopodis/

The IRS said Friday that it has **recovered $1.3 billion in unpaid taxes** from high-income Americans who had either failed to file their returns or who **hadn't fully paid what they owed.**  The announcement, made jointly with the U.S. Treasury Department, is aimed at highlighting the agency's ramped-up **enforcement efforts against tax cheats,** which have been funded under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

That IRS funding has proved controversial, with some **Republican lawmakers falsely claiming the** money would be used to hire 87,000 new IRS agents to ""to audit Walmart shoppers.""

Instead, the IRS says the money is being invested in improved customer service following years of snarls during the pandemic, as well as to **increase the number of audits on people with more than $1 million in** annual income and more than $250,000 in tax debts.

**125,000 high earners haven't paid taxes in years**

The initiative is designed **""to crack down on tax evasion** so that high earners pay what they owe,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in prepared remarks released ahead of a scheduled speech in Austin, Texas, on Friday. ""For too long, this hadn't been happening. Between 2010 and 2018, **the audit rate for millionaires fell by 80%.**"" She added, ""And during **the previous administration, as audit rates on high-income taxpayers fell,** the share of audits on taxpayers with incomes under $200,000 increased. In 2019, the top 1% of Americans was estimated to owe over one-fifth of unpaid taxes, **leaving ordinary Americans to shoulder the burden.""** Yellen said the IRS is pursuing 125,000 wealthy taxpayers who **haven't filed taxes in years.** With stronger enforcement, about 21,000 of those taxpayers have filed their returns over the last six months, paying $172 million in taxes, she added.

Those 21,000 taxpayers who have filed their taxes were the first to respond after the IRS reached out to alert them that they needed to file, according to a senior Treasury official who spoke on a conference call with reporters. **The IRS is likely to recoup hundreds of millions more in new tax revenue** from the remaining 104,000 people who still need to file, he said.

The agency is ready to use its enforcement authority to go after the remaining individuals who haven't yet filed, the official noted.

**Since the crackdown roughly 80% of 1,600 millionaires with overdue taxes have paid up,** providing an additional 1.1 billion dollars the Treasury said. That represents an increase of $100 million since July, when the IRS noted it had recovered $1 billion from this group of taxpayers.

It should be noted that, under Donald Trump, the U.S.A. experienced a manufacturing recession before the pandemic struck and lost more jobs than at any time since Herbert Hoover!

It should also be noted that, under President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the U.S. has experienced the lowest rates of unemployment and joblessness in more than a generation. However, we need to be starting to put in place new polices that will take effect as automation causes more widespread job losses, including among white-collar workers and professionals, such as doctors and lawyers.

Automation is the true threat to jobs. Donald Trump wants to demogogue against foreigners, instead, because they are easier to scapegoat. His arguments are about 30-40 years too late. He is stuck in the past. 

Vice President Kamala Harris, conversely, was delegated by President Biden to devote her attention to artificial intelligence and to develop policy responses in order to avoid disruptions that hurt people.

Tucker Carlson, the man so vile he was fired by Fox News,  has invited a sickening array of deranged fascistic zealots to join him on his streaming show, and to address his upcoming Bund meeting at the T-- Mobile Center in Kansas City.

T-Mobile, ""Can you hear the guttural, moral blasphemies echoing now?"" 

In their insatiable lust for power, the GOP has devolved into a morass of red-eyed drooling opportunists who would follow Satan himself into the raging fires of hell, for a sniff of the raw power Project 2025 foretells.

If some sanity doesn't return, if  some Republican loyalist doesn't stand up for Liberty and condemn fascism, our Democracy will be a  dim memory, and we will be ruled by a dictator even more amoral than Hitler, himself!

See this -- boldface mine.



This week, it became clear that the **sickness among Republicans and conservatives** who have been enthralled by Donald Trump is not going to end when he loses the presidential election. The disease will continue its course. Indeed, it is possible things will get worse. This week, **Tucker Carlson,** a man who had **a prime-time speaking slot at the Republican Convention** where he sat next to Trump, **invited Nazi sympathizer Darryl Cooper** onto his streaming show and into the lives of millions of his fans to **rehabilitate Adolf Hitler as a spurned peacemaker** who was pushed into **Jewish genocide** by a war-mongering Winston Churchill. This is insane.

**Next week**, Carlson is bringing his f**ascist apologia show to T-Mobile Center in Kansas City.** Some people are paying more than $100 to get close. **The next day, Carlson will be speaking before** thousands more in **Wichita at InTrust Bank Arena.** I don’t think this is what T-Mobile and InTrust had in mind when they paid for naming rights to these venues. Carlson is no fringe figure. As a Fox News commentator, he had an audience of millions five nights a week. When he became **too extreme for Fox** **to stomach,** millions followed him to his internet platforms where his commentary and interviews have only grown in popularity. His work has been **shared by billionaire X social network owner Elon Musk.**

Similarly, the guests who will be sharing the stage for his two shows, Megyn Kelly, a defrocked journalist, and Charlie Kirk, head of conservative group Turning Point USA, have millions of their own followers. Locally, Pete Mundo of KCMO has interviewed Carlson on his show.

Right now it is unclear if this descent into shilling for a long-dead dictator **responsible for the deaths of more than 50 million people** is enough to get Kelly, Kirk and Mundo to back away.

**Shilling for dictators** is a growing pastime for those in what remains of **conservative media** if this week’s other news is any indication. The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York **indicted two employees of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s propaganda organization for funneling $10 million** to a Tennessee firm, called Tenet Media, **to pay conservative influencers Benny Johnson, Tim Pool and Dave Rubin** — also with their own millions of followers — to **spew Kremlin propaganda to credulous conservatives** skeptical of U.S. involvement in the Ukraine war. A commentator for Glenn Beck’s Blaze Media was fired by that organization for her involvement in the scheme.

Johnson, Pool and Rubin claim to be victims in this fiasco that was part of a larger Russian effort to **influence the 2024 elections in favor of Trump.** As, yet they are unindicted, so it may be true that they were unwitting tools or, maybe more accurately, **fools for Putin.**

But let me tell you why Johnson, the worst among the three, is willing to take millions from unknown benefactors: He has no other choice because he is unemployable. The serial plagiarist has been fired over and over again for his shady dealings. It is not fair to say that all conservative media have been overtaken by edge-lord **fascism fluffing.** National Review, The Washington Free Beacon and The Dispatch, among others, provide solid reporting, untainted by Russian boodle, and commentary by writers unimpressed with Trump and his acolytes.

But millions of Americans are reading, listening and viewing news that appears to be from **a conservative perspective** but is untethered to reality by “journalists” who are willing to defend whatever garbage behavior or half-truth is convenient that day.

**As long as that is the case, Trump’s legacy will be with us.**",24,1,LetterGrouchy6053,Kamala,2024-09-07 11:44:18+00:00,0.86,/r/Kamala/comments/1fb50cx/did_your_parents_or_grandparents_fight_the_nazis/,False

Trump's MAGA Manifesto, Project 2025, demands reductions in any all entitlements, and almost exalts in its inhumanity; he will balance the budget on the stomachs of starving children. Trump's intended tax cuts for those already obscenely wealthy and the corporations providing that wealth will result in a massive shortfall in tax receipts and trillions more in national debt, and those funds have to be recouped in some manner.

The answer is drastic cuts to almost all government programs, most notably those which attend to the poor

and middle class.

Take a look at the devastating provisions in Project 2025 -- boldface mine.

Food Assistance

Project 2025

**...apply cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).** This means that many **people who need help buying food would no longer get money** from the government to buy food. \[298\]

...require states to implement work requirements for SNAP recipients. This means that people who are able to work would have to get a job or **do some type of work in order to get food stamps.** \[299\]

**...eliminate broad-based categorical eligibility.** This would make it **harder for people to get food stamps** because they would have to meet more requirements to be eligible. \[300\]

...eliminate the heat-and-eat loophole. This would make it **harder for people to get the full amount of food** stamps they are eligible for. \[301\]

...reform the Thrifty Food Plan. This could lead to people getting **less money in food stamps** because the government would change how it calculates the amount of money people need to buy food. \[300\]

**...eliminate CEP. This would mean that some children who currently get free school meals would have to pay for them**. \[303\]

1fa7qvo,Two ways the Democrats can mess this up,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kamala/comments/1fa7qvo/two_ways_the_democrats_can_mess_this_up/,"It really looks like Kamala has touched the hearts and minds of a wide range of people and that a landslide is even possible.

However, there's a long way to go (in a short period of time) and I'm a little concerned that some seem to think it's going to be easy.

First let's remember it's not over till it's over. MAGA is based on fear and there's a lot of brainwashed haters out there that will not respond to logic... 

As counter intuitive as it may seem, love is one of our most powerful weapons. So reach out whenever you have a chance... It's hard to hate a Harris supporter who loves you. 

On a closely related issue, let's hope for that landslide and prepare to follow up with a lot of peacemaking..

If Trump implodes, the Republican party is likely to fall apart.. they have been leaderless for too long.

And although that might seem good, it really isn't.. first of all it creates a vacuum where an even farther right hate filled group could fill the vacuum.. we don't need an openly fascist party to rise from the ashes. 

Or on the other side of the equation, if conservative values are simply gone then you could see a rise of the far left.. as most of you probably know, there can be great benefits to controlled socialism, but communism is an absolute disaster that never works. 

So what can we do? Start looking at every moderate conservative candidate and ask them to come to the table.. ask them to represent traditional, intelligent conservative values... Like balanced budgets and reasonable defense planning, even helping balance the scales between management and labor. 

How about Liz Cheney for a cabinet position? I'm pretty sure we will look back at her Jan 6 committee as the turning point.

1f8rl3l,A 28% corporate tax rate could indeed be more beneficial for rural areas,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kamala/comments/1f8rl3l/a_28_corporate_tax_rate_could_indeed_be_more/,"Continuing the Tax reform discussions, part 2-3 etc.

 a 28% corporate tax rate could indeed be more beneficial for rural areas. Here’s why:

# Benefits for Rural Areas with a 28% Corporate Tax Rate

* **Infrastructure Development**: Higher tax revenue can fund essential infrastructure projects like roads, bridges, and broadband internet, which are crucial for connecting rural areas to larger markets and improving quality of life.
* **Public Services**: Increased funds can enhance public services such as healthcare, education, and public safety, making rural areas more attractive to both residents and businesses.
* **Community Projects**: More resources can be allocated to community projects that improve local amenities and foster a sense of community.

# Key Considerations

* **Efficient Allocation**: It’s important to ensure that the additional funds are used efficiently and effectively to meet the specific needs of rural communities.
* **Local Engagement**: Engaging local stakeholders in planning and decision-making can help ensure that investments are aligned with community priorities.

# Conclusion

While both tax paths have their merits, the higher corporate tax rate of 28% offers the potential for immediate and impactful investments in rural infrastructure and public services. This can create a strong foundation for long-term growth and development in rural areas.

**More Detail:** A 28% corporate tax rate can be very beneficial for rural areas because it provides the government with more revenue to invest in essential infrastructure and public services. This means better roads, improved schools, and enhanced healthcare facilities, making rural areas more attractive for residents and businesses. Additionally, the increased funds can support community projects like parks and community centers, fostering a stronger sense of community and improving the overall quality of life.

Moreover, this higher tax rate can also support long-term growth through strategic tax credits and incentives. By offering tax credits for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and large businesses, the government can encourage investments in innovation, sustainability, and community development. Cutting double taxation on C-Corporations can further stimulate business growth, making it easier for companies to reinvest their profits into the economy.

Combining these strategies ensures that the 28% tax rate not only addresses immediate needs but also fosters sustainable economic growth. This approach can create a balanced and thriving economy, benefiting both rural areas and urban centers over the long term. So, while the higher tax rate provides immediate resources for public investment, it also lays the groundwork for future prosperity through thoughtful incentives and reduced tax burdens on businesses.

In comparison, a 15% corporate tax rate focuses on long-term growth by giving businesses more money to invest in their operations. This can lead to more jobs and economic activity over time, but the benefits might take longer to materialize. Small businesses in rural areas could thrive with lower taxes, leading to gradual economic improvement. However, this approach requires patience and additional support to help businesses grow initially. Both paths have their advantages, but the 28% rate offers more immediate benefits for rural development while also laying the groundwork for future prosperity through thoughtful incentives and reduced tax burdens on businesses.",16,4,Strict-Marsupial6141,Kamala,2024-09-04 12:06:56+00:00,0.99,/r/Kamala/comments/1f8rl3l/a_28_corporate_tax_rate_could_indeed_be_more/,False

Going down this play, I think Harris' choices for pairing with a 25-28% Corporate business tax rate (Donald is committed to the 15%) are,

'Closing Tax Loopholes: Identifying and closing tax loopholes can generate additional revenue without increasing overall tax rates. Sin Taxes: Increasing taxes on harmful products like tobacco and alcohol can discourage consumption and generate revenue. Environmental Taxes: Implementing taxes on pollution or carbon emissions can generate revenue while promoting environmental sustainability. Property Tax Reforms: Reassessing property values and increasing property taxes can generate additional revenue for local governments.'

This is to compete with that 15% Corporate business tax rate play, which still needs to be paired with neutral-balancers (in order to work properly in a way that is healthy, prosperous, sustainable for United States)'

Nextly, another path Kamala can go to match or surpass the 15% plan, is to go for an AI-Guided Tax system, or even something that typically has resistance, such as Modern VAT tax system 'fine-tuning VAT rates and exemptions to achieve specific economic objectives, automating and intelligent tax calculation etc.' This may actually feasible since we are already using AI more in US for many areas and in private sector. There could be significant gains this way, and it frees up IRS resources. Leveraging AI could also be the key and helpful for closing tax loopholes as well.

In addition 'AI can automate various tax administration tasks like registration, filing, and payment processing, reducing administrative burden.. automating registration, filing, and payment processing, AI can help ensure accurate and timely compliance, while minimizing administrative costs. This would be particularly important in managing the complexities of a multi-tiered VAT system or any changes in corporate tax structures, as it reduces the potential for errors and streamlines the process for businesses and individuals.' So this could be a potential play as well, and for Kamala etc.

And in response to those tax changes, and benefits from (including targeted tax cuts and credits), Kamala's strengths can be found in the Strong Anti-trust laws, Price transparencies (digital alerts - databases), and Consumer protection agencies - Settlements and strict penalties, etc. for abusers, and of course Whistleblower protections.

She could also do price monitoring systems and digital alerts, which 'backed by robust databases, can play a crucial role in preventing businesses from unjustly raising prices after a tax reduction or reform.' This is kind of like a stock ticker but for consumer goods and services.

*Combining these strategies can create a balanced and efficient tax system that promotes economic growth, sustainability, and fairness. Leveraging AI can enhance tax administration, close loopholes, and ensure compliance, while strong consumer protection measures can prevent abuse and maintain market integrity.*

Secondly,

*Integrating Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) and using AI can help finish manufacturing projects and fix transportation funding gaps by bringing in private investment and making better use of resources. Standardizing PPPs at the federal level with clear guidance and executive support can improve efficiency and consistency. This approach ensures strong end-to-end infrastructure development and better public services.*

Lastly and other ideas - Targeted Tax Credits and Expanding broader base such as.

Secondary Earner Tax Deduction (would help couples, including spouses), allowing low-wage dual-earning couples to keep more of their earnings, this deduction can provide financial relief and incentivize both partners to participate in the workforce. Helps spouses and especially Women.

Tax-Advantaged Accounts, Promoting the use of retirement accounts and HSAs can help couples save for the future and manage healthcare costs more effectively. Basically targeted tax credits for those who you use retirement savings, and health savings, to encourage saving in general and reducing burden.

and then,

For Small Businesses and in addition to permit expeditions, Payroll Alleviation - 'Payroll Tax Credits: Deferred Payroll Taxes: Allowing businesses to defer payment of payroll taxes'

(Kamala's cutting red tape)

Tax Credits for Healthcare Insurance - Offering tax credits for healthcare insurance can make it more affordable and increase coverage. The Premium Tax Credit helps cover the cost of health insurance premiums for those buying plans through the Health Insurance Marketplace, making healthcare more accessible. Additionally, providing tax credits for signing up for healthcare insurance plans can boost the number of insured individuals, leading to better public health outcomes.

Tax Credits for Employee-Paired Housing - Providing tax credits for employer-assisted housing can make housing more affordable for employees, improving their quality of life and reducing commuting times. This approach is especially beneficial in high-cost living areas, helping to attract and retain employees. Offering housing benefits not only enhances employee satisfaction but also supports workforce stability and productivity.",4,5,Strict-Marsupial6141,Kamala,2024-09-01 12:07:16+00:00,0.74,/r/Kamala/comments/1f6cvf1/closing_loopholes_targeted_tax_credits_what_can/,False

Do we need to file complaints?

https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/articles/27646986117268-TV-Form-Descriptions-of-Complaint-Issues

I used AI to generate this script:

> **Subject:** Inappropriate and Offensive Content on Fox News
>
> **To Whom It May Concern:**
>
> I am writing to file a complaint regarding a broadcast on Fox News featuring Jesse Waters, which aired on Monday, June 26th, 2024, at 5pm. During this broadcast, Jesse Waters made comments that were highly inappropriate, offensive, and arguably misogynistic, particularly in reference to Vice President Kamala Harris.
>
> **Details of the Complaint:**
>
> 1. **Misogynistic Comments:** Jesse Waters repeatedly used language that degraded and sexualized Vice President Kamala Harris. His remarks, including suggesting that she would be ""paralyzed in the situation room while the generals have their way with her,"" were not only offensive but also suggested a lack of respect for the office of the Vice President and for women in general.
> 2. **Inadequate Correction:** While Jesse Waters later attempted to clarify his comments, his on-air demeanor and the nature of his ""clarification"" were insincere and dismissive. It appeared that Fox News made a minimal effort to correct the situation, and Waters continued to make derogatory remarks later in the same broadcast.
> 3. **Pattern of Misconduct:** This is not an isolated incident. Jesse Waters has a history of making misogynistic comments, particularly towards women of color, and this behavior seems to be tolerated by Fox News. This repeated behavior reflects poorly on the network and its standards for content.
>
> **Impact:**
>
> The comments made by Jesse Waters were not only offensive but also harmful. They contribute to a broader culture of misogyny and racism, particularly against women of color in positions of power. It is unacceptable for a major news network to allow this type of content to air without serious consequences.
>
> **Resolution Sought:**
>
> I urge the FCC to investigate this incident and consider whether Fox News is in violation of any broadcasting standards related to decency, particularly concerning the treatment of women and people of color. I believe that stronger measures need to be taken to ensure that such offensive content is not allowed to continue unchecked.
>
> Thank you for your attention to this matter.
>
> **Sincerely,**

1ezli5n,"How Harris will or can fund the $25,000 credit to first-time homebuyers, about estimated 4.3 million annually, of them. (a detailed analysis)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kamala/comments/1ezli5n/how_harris_will_or_can_fund_the_25000_credit_to/,"To address the housing market’s challenges and support first-time homebuyers, Biden, Harris, and the government is considering a substantial credit program. 

(The figure of 4.3 million first-time homebuyers is based on a hypothetical calculation using the assumption that 5% of the adult population (estimated at 270 million) might purchase homes in a given year, and that 32% of these purchasers are first-time buyers. )

The idea is to offer a $25,000 credit to first-time homebuyers, which would require a significant budget allocation. To manage this, the government could split the cost with state governments, sharing the financial responsibility. About 108 bln usd ($25,000 credit, 4.3 mln first-time buyers) or so will be need in total. For example, a 50/50 split would mean both the federal and state governments would each need to find $54 billion USD to fund the program. A 60/40 cost sharing arrangement would be, say if the federal government covers 60% of the cost, it would need to allocate $64.8 billion USD, while the states would collectively contribute $43.2 billion USD (from their surplus or annual budget, any raised revenue they can make without burdening taxes on middle to lower brackets).

Raising such a large amount of money requires creative financial strategies. The federal government could start by lifting the cap on Social Security taxes for high earners, which would increase revenue without affecting the majority of taxpayers. Additionally, reforming the tax code to close loopholes and ensure that corporations and wealthy individuals pay their fair share could also boost the budget. They could also enforce existing ordinances more strictly to generate revenue through fines and fees. Encouraging population growth in certain areas can lead to higher property and sales tax collections.

Local governments could contribute by reforming zoning laws to increase the supply of affordable housing, which would, in turn, increase property tax revenues. They could also enforce existing ordinances more strictly, generating revenue through fines and fees. Encouraging population growth in certain areas can lead to higher property and sales tax collections, further supporting the initiative.

Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are another avenue to explore. These partnerships between the government and private housing companies can lead to more efficient and cost-effective housing developments. The government could provide incentives like tax credits or zoning concessions to attract private investment, while private entities bring in capital, expertise, and innovation. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) could be leveraged. 

These partnerships between the government and private housing companies can lead to more efficient and cost-effective housing developments. The government could provide incentives like tax credits or zoning concessions to attract private investment, while private entities bring in capital, expertise, and innovation.

By combining resources from federal and state budgets with contributions from the private sector, the government can create a robust system to support first-time homebuyers. This collaborative approach not only makes the program financially viable but also promotes sustainable development and economic growth in the housing sector. It’s a win-win situation where the government, private companies, and citizens all play a part in strengthening the housing market.

To facilitate such a partnership, both federal and state governments could establish agreements that outline the funding mechanisms, eligibility criteria, and program goals. States could leverage their own budgets, bonds, or other revenue sources to meet their share of the costs. Additionally, states could implement policies to encourage local investment in affordable housing, such as tax exemptions for developers or reimbursements for landlords[^(1)](https://www.multistate.us/insider/2022/4/20/states-look-to-address-affordable-housing-what-are-their-policy-options).



1. Estimate the Total Number of Homebuyers: Total Homebuyers=270,000,000×0.05Total Homebuyers=13,500,000
2. Calculate the Number of First-Time Homebuyers: First-Time Homebuyers=13,500,000×0.32First-Time Homebuyers=4,320,000

This calculation suggests that there could be approximately 4.32 million first-time homebuyers.

A synergistic approach that maximizes the strengths and resources of each sector to achieve a common goal can be utilized. By combining resources from federal and state budgets with contributions from the private sector, the government can create a robust system to support first-time homebuyers. This collaborative approach not only makes the program financially viable but also promotes sustainable development and economic growth in the housing sector. It’s a win-win situation where the government, private companies, and citizens all play a part in strengthening the housing market.

For instance, the government could relaunch partnerships between the Department of Treasury and HUD to provide low-cost capital for affordable housing development. This could involve raising equity caps for federal programs like the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC), which is a significant tool for constructing and rehabilitating affordable rental housing[^(3)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/01/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-immediate-steps-to-increase-affordable-housing-supply/). Additionally, Community Development Finance Institutions (CDFIs) and non-profit housing groups could receive more funding under programs like the Capital Magnet Fund to boost affordable housing production[^(3)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/01/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-immediate-steps-to-increase-affordable-housing-supply/).

By combining state and federal resources with private sector capabilities, these collaborative efforts can lead to the creation of more affordable housing units, stimulate local economies, and provide long-term solutions to housing challenges.

Streamlining government operations presents a significant opportunity for budget savings that could support initiatives like the proposed housing credit program. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has highlighted the potential to save over half a trillion dollars by eliminating inefficiencies and redundancies across federal agencies[^(1)](https://www.gao.gov/blog/where-can-government-save-money-weve-found-more-half-trillion-dollars-potential-savings). By consolidating operations and reevaluating programs to ensure they meet their objectives efficiently, the government can free up substantial funds. These savings could be redirected to critical areas such as housing, thereby enhancing the program’s sustainability without imposing additional financial burdens on taxpayers.

In the defense sector, there is a potential to save between 10 to 20 percent of the total budget by increasing productivity and streamlining non-combat operations[^(2)](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/preserving-combat-power-when-defense-budgets-are-falling). This can be achieved by aligning military forces with strategic objectives, optimizing functional expenditures, and reducing non-combat personnel. Such measures would preserve combat power while freeing up resources that could be allocated to domestic priorities like the housing credit program. Implementing these cost-saving strategies effectively is crucial for maintaining the program’s sustainability and ensuring fiscal stability, all while continuing to meet other essential government services.

the goal of streamlining government operations and defense spending is to achieve savings without compromising essential services or the nation’s strength. By focusing on efficiency and eliminating waste, the government can reallocate resources to vital programs like the housing credit initiative without reducing the effectiveness of other critical functions.

This doesn’t mean reducing military strength; rather, it’s about aligning forces with strategic goals and cutting unnecessary expenditures. These savings could then be redirected to domestic programs without compromising national security or essential services.

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) suggests that the government can save substantial amounts by consolidating functions and eliminating redundant services across various agencies. This approach ensures that the government’s core missions are not affected while freeing up funds for important projects like the housing credit initiative.

By adopting such a balanced strategy, the government can make every taxpayer dollar count, supporting both the nation’s defense and the well-being of its citizens. This careful management of resources is what will allow the housing credit program to be a sustainable effort, helping first-time homebuyers and bolstering the housing market for the long term.

Based on the hypothetical model discussed, the government’s housing credit program for first-time homebuyers is projected to generate a positive cash flow. With an initial investment of $108 billion USD and an estimated net return of $150 billion USD over 6-8 years, the program would yield a return of $1.39 for every dollar invested. This translates to an average annual cash flow of $7 billion USD over 6 years or $5.25 billion USD over 8 years, indicating that the program could be financially beneficial and sustainable, supporting economic growth while aiding first-time homebuyers.",16,3,Strict-Marsupial6141,Kamala,2024-08-23 19:28:54+00:00,0.87,/r/Kamala/comments/1ezli5n/how_harris_will_or_can_fund_the_25000_credit_to/,False

I want her to win, but I'm writing this out in case something bad happens. Let's remember this as a healing journey. We, as Americans, were tired of all the negativity.

It’s about creating an economy that not only sustains but also empowers, ensuring fair wages and equitable growth. This blueprint is dedicated to dismantling barriers and leveraging technology to open up global trade, setting the stage for a future where prosperity is not a privilege but a shared reality.

At the heart of this blueprint is the belief that a resilient economy is built on the foundation of inclusive governance. By prioritizing civil and human rights, every voice is amplified, and every paycheck is fair. The blueprint takes a firm stand against corporate overreach and price gouging, reinforcing consumer rights and managing inflation to benefit every household. It champions diversity and inclusion in the workplace, recognizing that our collective strength lies in our differences, fostering a culture where innovation and productivity flourish.
This economic policy is not just a set of goals; it’s a commitment to action. It’s about investing in sustainable practices and climate change solutions, ensuring a healthy planet parallels a robust economy. 

The blueprint also emphasizes enhancing border security and modernizing immigration processes to address labor gaps with a diverse, skilled workforce, including young Americans. It does not provide benefits to illegal immigrants but instead clarifies skilled worker roles. Drivers license access, currently state-based, will be further clarified at the Federal level with robust tests and exams. Always with a positive purpose.

The blueprint also reimagines public law enforcement with community-centric initiatives, enhancing safety and security for all. By streamlining immigration and modernizing border security, it supports a dynamic workforce.

Housing and Homeownership: The blueprint includes measures to address housing shortages and make homeownership more accessible. 

Tax Credits and Small Businesses: There are specific tax credits aimed at revitalizing factory towns and supporting small businesses. Healthcare and Education: The plan also emphasizes support for healthcare workers and focuses on education and workforce development.

The Opportunity Economy is a promise of a brighter future, where innovation, sustainability, and global leadership drive economic output. 

It’s a future where the U.S. sets the standard for a world where freedom, justice, and prosperity are not just ideals but tangible realities for all. This blueprint emphasizes enhancing border security and streamlining immigration processes, rather than providing housing to illegal immigrants. Always with a positive purpose.

Additionally, the blueprint focuses on cutting red tape and streamlining regulations, removing duplicate and burdensome regulations to foster a more efficient industrial sector. This approach aims to increase the percentage of sustainable industrial practices, targeting 30% and beyond. It also aims to reposition the U.S. as a leading global exporter, showcasing the nation’s commitment to being an industrial leader.",14,8,Strict-Marsupial6141,Kamala,2024-08-23 03:36:12+00:00,0.93,/r/Kamala/comments/1ez2yji/opportunity_economy/,False

----

I planned to travel to Pennsylvania to canvas for a week or so, and while I got a call from the campaign about volunteering and they said they'd be in touch within a week, but that was two weeks ago now and I haven't heard back.

Because I'd be travelling, I do need some information up front and can't just show up to volunteer.

----

**The main questions for me would be:**

1. Where they have offices
2. Where they need people on the ground most
3. When my time spent canvassing would make the biggest impact for the campaign

Anyone have advice to help me move forward on this? Thanks for reading!",6,5,Slapbox,Kamala,2024-08-20 01:23:52+00:00,0.99,/r/Kamala/comments/1ewj1s7/how_to_get_in_touch_with_campaign_about/,False

1evcj79,The GAO: Keeping Democracy on Track & Raising the Bar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kamala/comments/1evcj79/the_gao_keeping_democracy_on_track_raising_the_bar/,"The Government Accountability Office (GAO), though it may not be a household name, holds a vital role in shaping a brighter future for every American. Consider them the nation's vigilant watchdog, dedicated to ensuring that your tax dollars are not only spent wisely but also that government programs genuinely deliver on their promises.

Much like a professor who pushes you to excel, the GAO sets ambitious goals for federal agencies. It's not just about checking off tasks on a to-do list; it's about propelling tangible progress in the areas that truly count, such as accessible healthcare, quality education, and a robust economy.

The impact of the GAO's efforts is far from abstract - it's evident in the concrete improvements we witness: lower poverty rates, increased high school graduation rates, and reduced unemployment. These aren't mere statistics; they signify tangible opportunities and an improved quality of life for individuals and communities nationwide.

The GAO recognizes that tackling complex challenges requires a unified approach. They actively collaborate with other oversight agencies, pooling resources and strategies to achieve maximum impact. It's about working smarter, not harder, ensuring everyone is pulling together toward common goals.

Moreover, the GAO champions a culture of learning and innovation. By sharing insights and best practices, agencies can learn from each other's triumphs and missteps, ultimately leading to more effective policies and programs.

The GAO's work transcends mere spreadsheets and audits. It's about forging safer neighborhoods, cleaner streets, and stronger communities. Their vision extends beyond the numbers, ensuring that our tax dollars fuel programs that truly matter and create communities where every citizen feels safe, supported, and empowered.

The GAO is committed to addressing a spectrum of societal challenges. It's striving to alleviate poverty, improve public health, and guarantee access to quality education. It also looks beyond these traditional measures, tackling issues like crime rates, infrastructure upkeep, and access to social services. The ultimate goal is to nurture communities where everyone feels secure, supported, and equipped to flourish.

Recognizing that collaboration is key, the GAO actively partners with agencies responsible for public safety, sanitation, and social welfare. Together, they pool expertise and resources, developing innovative solutions to complex problems that no single entity could tackle alone.

Accountability is at the heart of the GAO's mission. They track progress on key metrics like the number of social workers employed or the frequency of street cleaning, guaranteeing that resources are used effectively and that communities truly see improvements.

While the GAO's work might not always grab headlines, its influence is undeniable. Through setting ambitious goals, demanding accountability, and fostering collaboration, it's shaping a brighter future for us all. So, next time you hear about the GAO, remember that it's not merely a bureaucratic agency; it's a tireless advocate for progress, working diligently to build a better nation for everyone.

As a nonpartisan entity serving the legislative branch, the GAO offers objective oversight, making sure our government works efficiently and effectively for the benefit of all. So, next time you hear about the GAO, remember: they're not just bureaucrats; they're the champions of progress, tirelessly working to build a better future for our nation.

All in all, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) is vital for a healthy democracy. As the ""congressional watchdog,"" it ensures your tax dollars are spent wisely and government programs truly help people. By setting ambitious goals and demanding accountability, the GAO pushes for real progress in areas that matter. 

It's not just about lofty ideals; it's about achieving tangible results and making life better for real people. This commitment to accountability and measurable outcomes makes the GAO a true force for positive change in our nation.

CNN previously reported that her broader economic policy will include a four-year plan to lower housing costs, including $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time homeowners and actions aimed at spurring the construction of new housing, including tax incentives for building starter homes. She is also expected to call for a federal ban on price gouging to lower grocery prices and everyday costs.'*

*A potential look at tax brackets in adjustment for inflation here (relief for bottom brackets, adjusting for new median salaries, 40 percent on over 500k etc.)*

*Harris’ proposal would restore the American Rescue Plan’s popular* [expansion of the child tax credit](https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/14/politics/child-tax-credit-payments-explainer/index.html?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_msn) *to as much as $3,600, up from $2,000, and call for it to be made permanent. The enhancement was* [only in effect](https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/30/politics/child-tax-credit-child-poverty/index.html?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_msn) *in 2021. Biden and Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill have been* [unsuccessful in their efforts](https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/20/politics/child-tax-credit-spending-bill/index.html?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_msn) *to partially revive it – in part because of its hefty price tag. A* [bipartisan bill](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/31/politics/house-vote-tax-bill-child-tax-credit/index.html?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_msn) *that would have temporarily beefed up the child tax credit passed the House earlier this year but was* [blocked by Republicans](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/01/politics/senate-tax-bill-vote/index.html?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_msn) *in the Senate.*

*The proposal would also add a new child tax credit of up to $6,000 for middle-class and lower-income families with children in their first year of life. That’s when a family’s expenses, such as cribs, diapers and car seats, can be at their highest and when many parents have to take time off from their jobs, the campaign noted.*

And of course child care for families, Moms. (Dads)

What the hell is the matter with them? I get being angry, but I don't think they realize what's at stake here. You'll be condemning Palestine, innocent American minorities, and the world with Trump.

Where are the protests against the Republicans who've talked about beach front property in Gaza, or Trump whose told Netanyahu to finish Palestine? Harris is the only way for an independent Palestine, and for peace.


Where are the calls for Hamas to cooperate, and actually take part in a ceasefire? How can you have a ceasefire when one side refuses to accept?

https://www.axios.com/2024/08/11/gaza-hostage-ceasefire-deal-hamas-talks

They're condemning Palestinians Edit: to a far bigger genocide.    if they let Trump win. And why don't American minority lives matter to them? Why don't the millions who will die from climate change?

I'm extremely concerned how they'll react if Iran drags us into war.

Gazans sure as hell don't want Trump.

I just don't know what she can do to win them over, we aren't going to not defend Israel. Especially if Iran attacks.

Edit: There is nothing that justifies literally holding Americans who have nothing to do with the war hostage. How is condemning trans people to death because you didn't' get your way morally ethical? Or for Palestine for that matter, the very people they are pretending to fight for?

Edit:2 its kind of despicable there are trolls defending letting Trump win. Just don't call yourself a trans ally then.

1eqphrb,"Kamala and Joe: Since the Executive Order on improving federal customer experience was signed in December 2021, the U.S. government has made substantial progress in enhancing the delivery of services to the American public.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kamala/comments/1eqphrb/kamala_and_joe_since_the_executive_order_on/,"Since the Executive Order on improving federal customer experience was signed in December 2021, the U.S. government has made substantial progress in enhancing the delivery of services to the American public.

The order aimed to streamline processes across various government interactions, such as retirement benefits, tax filings, disaster recovery, and more. By 2024, these initiatives have seen significant advancements, with agencies like the IRS improving call-back options for taxpayers, and the Department of State resuming its online passport renewal service.

In the realm of disaster recovery, FEMA has reformed its assistance policies to provide quicker and more expansive support for survivors. For education financing, the Department of Education has taken steps toward debt relief for student loan borrowers, simplifying the management of loans. The Department of Veterans Affairs has released an equity action plan to ensure all veterans receive their benefits, reflecting a commitment to service members transitioning to civilian life.

Efforts to modernize legacy systems have been a key focus, with a government-wide push towards cloud-based solutions to replace outdated technologies. This modernization is crucial for improving the efficiency and security of government services, reducing administrative burdens, and ensuring that government technology keeps pace with advancements in the field. The “Time Is Money” initiative further underscores this commitment by addressing corporate practices that waste Americans’ time and money.

*The Biden-Harris administration’s commitment to improving federal customer experience and service delivery has been backed by substantial investments and a focus on modernizing legacy systems.* 

In 2024, the President’s Budget proposed significant funding to enhance online services, such as expanding online passport renewal capabilities at the Department of State and improving the Social Security Administration’s customer experience. The Budget also supports the IRS’s initiatives to expand digital, phone, and in-person taxpayer assistance options, with improved data analytics to meet projected demand[^(1)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2024/03/11/fact-sheet-the-presidents-budget-improves-customer-experience-to-better-serve-the-american-people/).

In terms of technology modernization, the Technology Modernization Fund (TMF) announced investments aimed at enhancing public services and operational efficiency across key federal agencies. This includes the revamp of the Department of Education’s StudentAid.gov to streamline the student loan borrowing experience and the modernization of the Department of Commerce’s Weather.gov to provide easier access to critical weather and climate information. The Department of State also received investments to strengthen IT systems and integrate Generative AI capabilities to empower its global workforce[^(2)](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/technology-modernization-fund-announces-investment-05162024).

Furthermore, the FY 2024 Executive Summary from the U.S. Department of the Treasury outlines the allocation of funds for various initiatives, including $180 million for Energy Security tax credits, $816 million for Taxpayer Services, and over $1 billion for Business Systems Modernization. These investments demonstrate the administration’s dedication to not only improving the customer experience but also ensuring the security and efficiency of government services through technological advancements[^(3)](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/266/02.-Executive-Summary-FY-2024-BIB.pdf). The ongoing efforts reflect a strategic approach to government service delivery, aiming to create a more responsive, transparent, and user-friendly federal system for all Americans.

Vice President Kamala Harris has played a pivotal role in these efforts, particularly through the “Time Is Money” initiative and historic funding to bolster equitable healthcare. The administration’s comprehensive strategy aims to ensure that government services are not only efficient and equitable but also accessible to all Americans. The redesign of [USA.gov](http://USA.gov) into a centralized digital portal is part of this strategy, simplifying access to government services and benefits and furthering the administration’s dedication to putting the public first and rebuilding trust in government.

Vice President Kamala Harris is set to continue the momentum of enhancing government service delivery with a forward-looking approach. Building on the foundation laid by the Biden-Harris administration, she plans to further streamline government processes, expand digital access, and invest in modern infrastructure. [With a focus on equity and efficiency, Vice President Harris will prioritize initiatives that not only improve the customer experience but also ensure that government services are accessible and responsive to all Americans, particularly in areas like broadband connectivity and clean energy](https://apnews.com/article/broadband-biden-bead-harris-highspeed-470fe2b44a6e62d8b2ea3eca3272e210)[^(1)](https://apnews.com/article/broadband-biden-bead-harris-highspeed-470fe2b44a6e62d8b2ea3eca3272e210)[^(2)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/oncd/briefing-room/2024/08/09/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-priorities-for-enhancing-the-digital-ecosystem-to-support-a-secure-energy-future/).
