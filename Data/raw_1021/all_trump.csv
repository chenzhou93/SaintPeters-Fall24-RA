1g9jdov,Trump is doing more damage than the storm.,https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/1g9jdov/trump_is_doing_more_damage_than_the_storm/,"

North Carolina, it is simply beyond comprehension that you can support a man who has gone out of his way to do further harm to your storm ravaged communities; he doesn't give a damn about the pain his constant lying provokes!

It's plain to see his lies are meant to manipulate, to deceive, and if he can convince you through his duplicity that your own government is working against you, then that will fulfill the lust for power that drives him.

He claims he has policies that will cure America's ills, yet he never divulges any real policy, Rather, in his rallies he concentrates on spreading fear, causing division, and trying to manipulate through terror tactics by taking your attention from the real issue.

Listen to his words, do you really believe any of them? And if you see the absurdity now, consider whether he'll ever follow through on his promises.

Look at this -- boldface mine.



""Communities across the Southeast, most notably in North Carolina, have spent the last several weeks trying to recover from Hurricane Helene and its aftermath. It was against this backdrop that **Donald Trump** visited the Tar Heel State two weeks ago and pursued a radical idea: Maybe, the former president said, he could advance his own interests by **brazenly lying about the governmental response** to the deadly storm. **State and local officials, including plenty of Republicans,** asked him to **stop deceiving** the public, but he ignored the appeals ‚Äî even as evidence emerged that **Trump‚Äôs lies were having an adverse impact** on the response to the crisis.

It was, by some measures, a genuine **election-season scandal:** The GOP nominee for the nation‚Äôs highest office saw **devastated communities and human suffering,** which inspired **Trump to repeatedly lie about the heartbreaking circumstances,** hoping it would advance **his quest for power.** Two weeks later, he did it again. NBC News reported that the former president returned to North Carolina, where he ‚Äúagain **made the false claim that FEMA had no money to help victims in the hurricane-stricken area because it was spending funds on migrants.‚Äù**

As he‚Äôs done for weeks, Trump appeared to conflate two completely separate funds to paint a **misleading picture**. FEMA has **dedicated disaster relief money that cannot be used for other purposes,** and it was separately tasked by Congress in 2022 to disseminate money from Customs and Border Protection to help communities that received influxes of migrants. ‚ÄúThey spent a lot of money on bringing illegal migrants. ... They don‚Äôt have any money for the people who live here,‚Äù **Trump said, despite reality.** ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve spent it on illegal migrants.‚Äù

**He was, of course, lying ‚Äî** or more to the point, he was echoing previous lies, which he knows have been discredited, but which he continued to repeat in the hopes that it‚Äôll benefit him personally.

Reminded that these and related conspiratorial lives have led to threats against FEMA workers in the area, Trump expressed relative indifference. ‚ÄúI think you have to let people know how they‚Äôre doing,‚Äù he told reporters. ‚ÄúIf they‚Äôre doing a poor job, are we not supposed to say it?‚Äù I‚Äôm not in a position to say whether Trump actually believes his lies, or whether he knows he‚Äôs peddling nonsense. But either way, the consequences of his dangerous lies are the same.

To be sure, I‚Äôm mindful of the broader circumstances: North Carolina is a highly competitive battleground state, and the latest polling suggests he‚Äôs effectively tied with Vice President Kamala Harris in the state. It‚Äôs hardly surprising that the Republican has concluded that he‚Äôll say whatever he has to say, regardless of accuracy or propriety, to get ahead.

But there is a risk of a backlash. If you‚Äôre an on-the-fence North Carolinian, unsure which candidate to support, and **one candidate comes to your state to lie about the response to a deadly natural disaster,** would you be more or less likely to vote for that candidate?

Trump could‚Äôve simply made an appearance and expressed his support. He instead decided to take a chance by peddling easily discredited nonsense.

A lady called with a Cary number saying she was with ‚ÄúDemocratic Volunteer‚Äù then she asked me the following:

Her: How can we get you to go out and vote? Reply: I already did..

Her: Did you vote for Trump? Reply: No

Her: Did you vote for Harris Reply: Yes

Her: oh you voted for Harris?

Her: For governor who did you vote for? 
Reply: I answered before she finished ‚ÄúJosh Stein‚Äù

She says ‚ÄúOh ok. Thank you.‚Äù And then asks ‚ÄúWould you like to volunteer for Team Trump?‚Äù

WHAT!?

I asked her again who she she‚Äôs with any she says ‚ÄúTeam Harris‚Äù but then when I asked her why she asked me to volunteer for ‚ÄúTeam Trump‚Äù she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just trying to get people to volunteer.‚Äù

I asked her again ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre Team Harris why are you asking me to volunteer for Team Trump?‚Äù Her: ‚ÄúI just want people to volunteer, it‚Äôs an important election.‚Äù

I shouldn‚Äôt have answered her questions‚Ä¶.
Now reflecting, I should have know something was up when she asked me if I voted for Trump as her first question after her intro. 

Has anyone else had a call like this?

I'm a black man from Detroit, and there are other black men here who are talking about voting for Trump. Things get a little interesting though when you show them the clips of Trump wanting to send the military to the cities. AND with him *recently* using that same language about using the military on ""the enemy within,"" it makes you wonder if the people in the inner cities are included in this ""enemy within."" It'd be nice if Trump had to provide an answer for this, since he never has to answer for shit else.",40,53,Noofinator2,thedavidpakmanshow,2024-10-22 09:04:46+00:00,0.92,/r/thedavidpakmanshow/comments/1g9dquc/trump_and_black_men/,False
