# The Facts

* The members of the Central Park Five ‚Äî whose conviction of the 1989 rape of a woman in Central Park, NYC, was overturned in 2002 ‚Äî are suing former US Pres.

* During the debate, Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris alluded to how Trump ""took out a full-page ad in the New York Times calling for the execution of five young black and Latino boys,"" referring to his public response to the crime at the time.[\[3\]](https://nypost.com/2024/10/21/us-news/central-park-five-sue-trump-charging-false-and-defamatory-statements-during-debate/)

* The lawsuit ‚Äî filed by Korey Wise, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana, Kevin Richardson, and Antron McCray ‚Äî claims the statements were ""false and defamatory,"" arguing that they ""never pled guilty"" and that ""none of the victims of the Central Park assaults were killed.""[\[5\]](https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/central-park-five-sue-trump/2024/10/21/id/1184875/)[\[6\]](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/nyregion/trump-central-park-five-defamation-lawsuit.html)

* This comes after the five, whose convictions were eventually overturned on the basis of DNA evidence, reached a $41M settlement with NYC in 2014 over their wrongful imprisonment.[\[4\]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/10/21/trump-central-park-five-lawsuit/)

The Spin

Left narrative

Donald Trump has made openly racist comments for decades, ranging from his response to the original Central Park 5 arrests to this more recent debate with Harris. Not only were these men wrongfully arrested, put behind bars, and smeared by figures like Trump in 1989, but they continue to face false accusations today. If he wishes to continue defaming innocent people, he must face the consequences in court.

Right narrative

Trump never mentioned the race of the Central Park Five 1989, and he, like the rest of the public, was under the impression that they were guilty. Misspeaking about a group of men who happen to be Black doesn't make someone racist. Even though the media know this, they'll continue to smear Trump so as to achieve their real goal: stopping him and his policies on crime prevention from getting back to the White House.

1g9eh82,Voting for Kamala is quite literally going against God. Here‚Äôs why. ,https://v.redd.it/h1nj1sas6awd1,"I saw this Tik Tok video posted to X and was mind blown!!!!

Being a Democrat could very likely or literally land you in hell if it exists. If Kamala is not the Antichrist herself, she is 100% an incarnate of a demonic form. 

As someone who lives in Los Angeles, I can 100% confirm to you that Hollywood is fully satanic. Everyone knows someone with a personal story with firsthand experience as either a witness or someone who briefly got sucked in. It‚Äôs something you harshly realize when you move here. They have ritualistic parties, practice dark crafts, and offer themselves to the devil. 

I‚Äôm telling you that shit is so real! Satanic practice is as real in Los Angeles, especially within the elite circles, as voodoo is in New Orleans. It‚Äôs not a secret to people here. So anyone that‚Äôs been theorizing and/or suspecting of this, you are correct. 

Also take note of how Hollywood is hardcore left. If you sell your soul, you have to follow the evil or else your career and reputation will be destroyed. It‚Äôs why you see people like Usher who was associated with Diddy singing at Kamala‚Äôs rally. 

When an upcoming celebrity wants to rise rapidly to fame, one of the initiation rituals into giving their life to darkness is releasing music regarding the devil, and selling their soul to him. Take Lil Nas for example. Or Doja Cat. 

One thing that is described about the end of times is that evil will be seen as good, and good will be seen as evil. If we fail to understand the truth and choose the right path, this is it. It‚Äôs why you suddenly have Elon Musk, a heavily scientific mind, talking about God.

This is not just an election that could determine the fate of humanity, but the true deeper root behind it is the great spiritual war.

I have so many chills writing this. 

You may not like Elon Musk (I do), but he is someone who was notoriously left and his 3 goals in life have always been, 1) To expand human consciousness and get humans to mars; 2) transform earth into a planet that uses sustainable energy; and 3) make robots and AI safe for its future in our society. 
^^^ so for him *specifically* to suddenly come out of the woodworks blaring red alarms, waving hundreds of red flags, and giving warnings that Trump losing will be the end of humanity, you would have to be stupid not to sit down and really think wit the fuck this is happening.

I can confidently tell you that no man, even a billionaire is going to pull this level of humanity ending warning stuff over fucking taxes, especially come *literally* out of left field for it.üòÇ He‚Äôs a genius with 1000 other ways he could persuade the public to vote one way if he had that vendetta, but it‚Äôs super clear that reasons within those lines simply don‚Äôt exist within his motives behind his campaign for Trump. Sure he agrees with republican tax policies but if we‚Äôre talking about the reasons behind his repeated warnings, that ain‚Äôt it. 

I‚Äôm not religious by any means, but knowing what I do, even I can attest to this shit. It‚Äôs real. All of it. It‚Äôs in front of everyone‚Äôs face. 

Remember, Kamala just told someone who said ‚ÄúJesus is King‚Äù that they are at the wrong rally. 

Had I not moved to Los Angeles, I wouldn‚Äôt have as many chills writing this as I do, and I absolutely had to share this video because it confirmed everything. ",202,29,SonicDooscar,trump,2024-10-22 10:00:50+00:00,0.85,/r/trump/comments/1g9eh82/voting_for_kamala_is_quite_literally_going/,False

Trump is 78.  It's hard to watch.  Is anyone concerned about this?  Vance would definitely have to take over before the end of four years and he has very little experience, especially with dealing with world leaders.  Everyone really has to consider that you are really voting for Vance at this point and how you feel about that.  I know little about him except he parrots whatever Trump says and he wrote the forward to the book that Project 2025 is based on, which does not sit well with me after reading through it this weekend.  It's crazy frankly.  His support of project 2025 would dismantle the Dept of Education, Social Security, protections around health insurance, such as preexisting conditions, and the ability to do away with the protections around our constitution, no overtime pay any longer.....and that's only the beginning.  It's a playbook for a dictatorship versus a democracy and could be our last chance to vote possibly ever...so you better be damned sure.  Trump can claim distance from project 2025 (although his name is mentioned over 300 times in it) but Vance has openly discussed it before his VP days when he wasn't allowed any longer to mention it.  Like I said, he wrote the forward to the book!  Publishing of the project 2025-inspired book was held off till post-election date.  Lots to consider here.  He's against people being childless so what happens if my kid chooses that path.  Will she have fewer rights or opportunities if she has no kids?  So much to consider.

# The Facts

* In an interview with Rev. Al Sharpton aired on MSNBC, Democratic nominee Vice Pres. Kamala Harris claimed that GOP candidate former Pres. Donald Trump ""demeans"" the office of US president.[\[1\]](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/presidential/3196338/harris-says-trump-demeans-the-presidency/)[\[2\]](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/harris-trump-demeans-office-president-rcna176302)
* Harris alleged Trump ""should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States,"" stating that he had ""not earned the right"" which was ""why he's going to lose.""[\[3\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdJudytCMK0)[\[4\]](https://spectrumlocalnews.com/tx/san-antonio/news/2024/10/21/harris-says-trump--demeans--the-presidency-after-he-uses-a-profanity-to-describe-her-record-as-vice-president)
* This comes after the former President described Harris using profanity when speaking to a crowd in Latrobe, Pennsylvania on Saturday.[\[5\]](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/harris-trump-court-early-voters-usher-lizzo-campaign-trail-2024-10-19/)
* The interview also saw Harris describe the number of innocent deaths in Gaza as ""unconscionable,"" and described the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar as the removal of ""an obstacle"" to ensuring peace in the region.[\[3\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdJudytCMK0)[\[6\]](https://www.verity.news/story/2024/israel-hamas-leader-yahya-sinwar-killed-in-rafah)[\[7\]](https://www.msnbc.com/politicsnation/watch/harris-death-of-yahya-sinwar-has-removed-an-obstacle-to-peace-222246469834)
* Harris also stated that she must ""earn the vote of everyone regardless of their race or gender,"" and that the idea that she could ""take for granted the vote of Black men"" was an ""uninformed"" perspective from some journalists.[\[8\]](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2024/10/20/kamala_harris_i_dont_take_support_from_black_men_for_granted_i_must_earn_every_vote.html)[\[9\]](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/10/20/2024-elections-live-coverage-updates-analysis/kamala-harris-al-sharpton-shirley-chisholm-00184556)
* According to FiveThirtyEight's averages, since June 30, Harris' favorability rating has increased by over fifteen points from -16.3 to -0.7. A September CNN/SSRS poll found that Harris (79%) currently holds a 63-point lead over Trump (16%) among Black voters.[\[10\]](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/kamala-harris/)[\[11\]](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25172742/cnn-poll-harris-and-trump-locked-in-exceedingly-close-presidential-race.pdf)

# The Spin

# Democratic narrative

Trump's hateful post-truth propaganda attempts to divide the American people in the pursuit of power. Such polarizing behavior is unbecoming of a candidate seeking to become president and goes against the very values of the country he seeks to lead. Seeing himself as an unchallengeable authority and hellbent on stoking societal tensions, Trump must be stopped from returning to the White House at all costs.

[The Gonzaga Bulletin](https://www.gonzagabulletin.com/opinion/trump-s-hateful-rhetoric-and-the-threat-to-democratic-values/article_79c8f9c0-8b4f-11ef-a9b9-9f82569f634d.html)

It is no surprise that the Democratic campaign is losing momentum ‚Äî Harris is an unpopular and unimpressive candidate forced upon the American people by the establishment elite. Having failed at the first hurdle during her 2020 presidential bid before undertaking one of the least successful tenures as Vice President in American history, it's laughable that Democrats expect the public to believe it is Trump, and not Harris, who is unfit for office.

So if we have all been laughing at her (i'm British) i'm sure other peoples, leaders have also laughed along with us. 

Lets face facts, she got the VP job for 2 reasons, she's black and she is a woman, if she was white and a man she wouldn't have got within a bajillion miles of the most powerful job on the planet and how does she go from a Global laughing stock to being respected and seen as a leader who will do everything to end war (Trump Policy) ban tax on tips (Trump policy), get tougher on the wall and border security (Trump policy) and be anything other than a toothless World leader who can be manipulated as everyone knows Obama will be pulling the strings.

I'm not and never have been racist or a misogenious man, my own children and of mixed heritage but the ONLY reason she got VP was because shes black-ish (lol) and a woman, thats her credentials for the Oval Office.

We have not spoken to each other in a decade. She right off the bat asked me about what I thought about Trump. I was not looking to get into politics right away. We have always been on opposite sides, me being Libertarian, and see an avowed Socialist.

I would like to think that I can be friends with anyone, regards of political affiliation. That used to be the case, but not anymore.

The leftist media has been very busy spreading vicious lies about Trump. Early on I checked out every claim they made and have found them to be FALSE. EVERY SINGLE ONE.

So I support Trump. I want to see Trump win in 2024, and will be sending in my ballot shortly. And if someone wants to defriend me for my support, so be it.

Trump 2024.

===============================

I decided to post my former friend's response here. To say this is vitriolic is the understatement of the millennium. Prepare yourself for a peek into the mind of someone thunderstruck with TDS. It is not pretty.

>*I honestly can't speak to you anymore. Trump is slime, a con artist, a rapist, and a traitor who licks Putin's ass. Anyone who loves him is also a traitor and deeply stupid for falling for his act.*

  
She knows me better than this. She knows that I am hyper-rational, critical thinker who checks things out.

>*He has outright told us he plans to replace all non-partisans working in government with loyalists and that he'll be a dictator on day one.*

Trump never said that, of course. And all presidents tend to replace people in the bureaucracy with their friends. Nothing new there.

>*His cultists are warming to the idea, and are now saying it's time for us to have a dictator. He loves Hitler, and wants to be the next one.*

I truly don¬¥t know where she gets this stuff from. She was not this bad 10 years ago.

>*And if you think anyone with your skin color will be safe in his America, you are sadly mistaken. He says he plans to round up not just illegal, but also legal immigrants in internment camps,*

Oh, right into the Race FUDding crap. Probably because more blacks than ever support Trump. But she is buying this rhetoric hook, line, and sinker. She is not the same person I knew.

>*and calls all non-white countries ""shithole countries,"" so good luck getting your wife over here.*

I married a girl in Colombia, and will have no problems with that if we decide to do that. I know the procedure, as I did it once before. But my wife doesn¬¥t really want to live in the US anyway. Europe would be a better choice, overall, for a number of reasons. But that's not something I will discuss here. And he never said that all ""non-white"" countries are shitholes.

>*He'll make sure all women's bodies are state-owned property, and under him, not only will abortion be illegal, but so will birth control for women. I'm sorry, but goodbye.*

My word. This sounds like it was ripped right of of Kamala's playbook.

There is no way to reason with that. TDS big time. And not worth my time at all. All lies, propaganda, and spin-doctoring. Now that I've had the chance to go over what she said more closely, the feeling is mutual. Not my friend. Good riddance. Yuck.

1g6n8mj,Kamala Voter Meltdown,https://www.reddit.com/r/trump/comments/1g6n8mj/kamala_voter_meltdown/,"Last night I was at a Panera Bread in Lancaster, PA, a marginally red county that has seen an influx of NY and NJ people moving in and taking their politics with them. 
Two of the three kiosks were broken and the line at the counter was long. A couple and their children were standing at the electronic kiosk flipping though the menu over and over again like their life depends on which sandwich they are going to order from Panera. They were completely oblivious to the line of people forming behind them. One lady literally left the store.
After about 10 minutes of this nonsense I started to think about how entitled these people were and how they must be Democrats. My blood was boiling but I don‚Äôt like confrontation so I bit my lip. Finally they finish, but one of their kids parks her ass in front of the kiosk. I simply reach over the kid and start typing my order.
‚ÄúYou couldn‚Äôt wait until we finished,‚Äù the mother said. ‚ÄúYou have got to be kidding me,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúYou people think you are the only people in the world,‚Äù I continued. After she became irate and said something else to me I simply replied and said, I can tell you are a couple of Harris Voters.‚Äù With a red angry lib face she replied, ‚ÄúDamn straight we are you Trumper!‚Äù

Harris voters can be identified easily because they are assholes. They are the people in the left lane doing 47MPH who won‚Äôt move over. They block the grocery store aisle with their cart. Yes, they‚Äôll even treat a chain restaurant as if they own the place.

But this time it's going to be too big to rig and I believe Trump is going to win in a landslide but they're going to say he cheated or they're going to say he is a convicted felon and he's not allowed to take office or they're going to not certify the election in certain States or they're going to pull some type of deep State false flag event to try to delay the inevitable outcome of trump becoming president. The main reason they don't want him president is because he is consistently exposing the Deep State system. Just wait until the Federal Reserve comes into the spotlight the Real Enemy of the people..

Remember, all of the things we see revolve around our broken, corrupt enslavement financial system. Got gold got crypto? Anything anti-dollar. Over the next 5 years, we're going to see some incredible things.  We need it...  We need to see people arrested for treason and Corruption otherwise we don't have a country or a constitution..

What type of deep State Falls flag are they going to pull right around the election in order to delay or block Trump getting in the White House? Remember the insurrection? Well, there's going to be a real Insurrection when Trump wins. I think January 6th was just to educate the people on what an Insurrection is when, in reality, it was a fake deep state event and antifa posing as (some) Trump supporters. A few bad apples but mostly just BS.
That being said that event educated the people on an Insurrection so when Trump wins we're going to see probably a lot of riots and a real insurrection and maybe I ran and other countries getting involved they're going to try to create a major scare/fear event. Everything is on the line for the Deep state it's all or nothing so they're going to do whatever it takes so be ready stay vigilant and be cautious of Black Swan events and deep State false flag events assassination attempts insurrections riots and everything else in between God Bless America and God bless president Trump and I can't wait to see the day they eat s*** and die",18,32,North-Network-7742,trump,2024-10-17 23:28:12+00:00,0.67,/r/trump/comments/1g64h3o/what_happens_if_trump_wins_but_they_wont_let_him/,False

Bret Baier: Madam Vice President, thank you for the time.

Kamala Harris:
Thank you. It‚Äôs good to be with you, Bret.

Bret Baier:
Voters tell pollsters all over the country and here in Pennsylvania that immigration is one of the key issues that they‚Äôre looking at this election and specifically the influx of illegal immigrants from more than 150 countries. How many illegal immigrants would you estimate your administration has released into the country over the last three-and-half years?

Kamala Harris:
Well, I‚Äôm glad you raised the issue of immigration because I agree with you. It is a topic of discussion that people want to rightly have and you know what I‚Äôm going to talk about right now, which is-

Bret Baier :
Yeah, but just a number. Do you think‚Äôs 1 million? 3 million?

Kamala Harris :
Bret, let‚Äôs just get to the point. Okay. The point is that we have a broken immigration system that needs to be repaired.

Bret Baier :
Your Homeland Security secretary said that 85% of apprehensions-

Kamala Harris :
But I‚Äôm not finished, I‚Äôm not finished. We have an immigration system-

Bret Baier :
It‚Äôs a rough estimate of 6 million-

Kamala Harris : 
‚Ä¶ that needs to be‚Ä¶

Bret Baier :
‚Ä¶ people have been released into the country. And let me just finish. I‚Äôll get to the question, I promise you.

Kamala Harris :
I was beginning to answer.

Bret Baier :
And when you came into office, your administration immediately reversed a number of Trump border policies, most significantly, the policy that required illegal immigrants to be detained through deportation either in the US or in Mexico. And you switched that policy, they were released from custody awaiting trial. So instead, included in those were a large number of single men, adult men who went on to commit heinous crimes. So looking back, do you regret the decision to terminate remain in Mexico at the beginning of your administration?

Kamala Harris :
At the beginning of our administration, within practically hours of taking the oath, the first bill that we offered Congress, before we worked on infrastructure, before the Inflation Reduction Act, before the Chips and Science Act, before the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the first bill, practically within hours of taking the oath, was a bill to fix our immigration system.

Bret Baier :
Yes, ma‚Äôam. It was called the US Citizenship Act of 2021.

Kamala Harris :
Exactly.

Bret Baier :
It was essentially a pathway to citizenship for the-

Kamala Harris :
May I please finish?

Bret Baier :
Yes, ma‚Äôam.

Kamala Harris :
May I finish responding please?

Bret Baier :
But here, but this-

Kamala Harris :
But you have to let me finish, please.

Bret Baier :
You had the White House and the House and the Senate and they didn‚Äôt bring up that bill.

Kamala Harris :
I‚Äôm in the middle responding to the point you‚Äôre raising.

Bret Baier :
Okay.

Kamala Harris :
And I‚Äôd like to finish.

Bret Baier :
Yes, ma‚Äôam.

Kamala Harris :
We recognized from day one that to the point of this being your first question, it is a priority for us as a nation and for the American people. And our focus has been on fixing a problem. And from day one then, we have done a number of things, including to address our asylum system and put more resources, getting more judges, what we needed to do to tighten up penalties and increase penalties for illegal crossings, what we needed to do to deal with points of entry between border entry points. That‚Äôs the work we did.And we worked on supporting what was a bipartisan effort, including some of the most conservative members of the United States Congress, to actually strengthen the border. That border bill would have put 1,500 more border agents at the border, which is why I believe the border patrol agents supported the bill. It would‚Äôve allowed us to stem the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States, which is a scourge affecting people of every background, every geographic location in our country, killing people. It would‚Äôve allowed us to put more resources into prosecuting transnational criminal organizations, which I have done-

Bret Baier :
Yes, ma‚Äôam

Kamala Harris :
‚Ä¶ as the attorney general, former attorney general of a border state.

Bret Baier :
Madam Vice President, a couple things.

Kamala Harris :
Prosecuted trafficking of drugs, guns, and human beings. And Donald Trump-

Bret Baier :
Six Democrats-

Kamala Harris :
But let me just finish. And Donald Trump-

Bret Baier :
Six Democrats voted against that bill.

Kamala Harris :
‚Ä¶ learned about that bill and told them to kill it because he preferred to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. And in this election, this is rightly a discussion that the American people want to have and what they want are solutions and they want a president of the United States who‚Äôs not playing political games with the issue-

Bret Baier :
I hear you.

Kamala Harris :
‚Ä¶ but actually is focused on fixing it.

Bret Baier :
Six Democrats voted against that bill. It would‚Äôve allowed 1.8 million illegal immigrants into the country a year. A lot of conservatives had a problem with it. These are the six Democrats. But more importantly, back to the original premise, Jocelyn Nungaray, Rachel Morin, Laken Riley, they are young women who were brutally assaulted and killed by some of the men who were released at the beginning of the administration, well before a negotiated bipartisan bill. Former President Clinton actually referred to Laken Riley Sunday, campaigning for you in Georgia, saying if those men had been properly vetted, Laken Riley probably would not have been killed.So it wouldn‚Äôt have happened. This is well before any negotiation. This is well before Donald Trump got involved in the politics. This is a specific policy decision by your administration to release these men into the country. So what I‚Äôm saying to you, do you-

Kamala Harris :
No, no, Bret. I think it‚Äôs really-

Bret Baier :
‚Ä¶ owe those families an apology?

Kamala Harris :
Let me just say, first of all, those are tragic cases. There‚Äôs no question about that. There is no question about that and I can‚Äôt imagine the pain that the families of those victims have experienced for a loss that should not have occurred. So that is true. It is also true that if a border security had actually been passed nine months ago, it would be nine months that we would‚Äôve had more border agents at the border, more support for the folks who are working around the clock trying to hold it all together-

Bret Baier :
Madam Vice President-

Kamala Harris :
‚Ä¶ to ensure that no future harm would occur. And this election in 20 days will determine whether we have a president of the United States who actually cares more about fixing a problem even if it is not to their political advantage in an election, because there was a solution, Bret.

Bret Baier :
Madam Vice President, it was a policy decision in the early part of your administration. I will let one of the mothers talk about it. Take a listen.

Speaker 3 (mother of victim) :
‚ÄúBecause of the Biden-Harris administration open border policy‚Äôs catch and release, they were enrolled in the alternatives to detention program. This meant that they were released into the United States. It was not even a full three weeks later that they would take my daughter, Jocelyn Nungaray‚Äôs life. I believe the Biden-Harris administration open border policies are responsible for the death of my daughter‚Äù

Bret Baier :
That‚Äôs the early days. So do you owe them an apology? Is what I‚Äôm saying.

Kamala Harris :
I will tell you that I am so sorry for her loss. I‚Äôm so sorry for her loss, sincerely. But let‚Äôs talk about what is happening right now with an individual who does not want to participate in solutions. Let‚Äôs talk about that as well, Bret.

Bret Baier :
But do you want to answer her?

Kamala Harris :
In all fairness. I told you I feel awful for what she and her family have experienced.

Bret Baier :
During that time, you said repeatedly that the border was secure. When in your mind did it start becoming a crisis?

Kamala Harris :
I think we‚Äôve had a broken immigration system transcending, by the way, Donald Trump‚Äôs administration, even before. Let‚Äôs all be honest about that. I have no pride in saying that this is a perfect immigration system. I‚Äôve been clear, I think we all are, that it needs to be fixed. We need more‚Ä¶I was just down at the border, talking with border agents and they will tell you, and I‚Äôm sure you probably, I know you investigate and you are a serious journalist, they will tell you we need more judges. We need to process those cases faster. We need the support for those cases that should be prosecuted. They need more resources and Congress ultimately is the only place that that‚Äôs going to get fixed, Bret. That‚Äôs how the system works.

Bret Baier :
That‚Äôs the premise of this question.

Kamala Harris :
But that‚Äôs how the system works.

Bret Baier :
There were 90 plus executive orders that were rescinded in the first days. Many of those were Trump border policies. I‚Äôm not going to stay here because there‚Äôs other things to talk about, but you frequently talked to the Border Patrol Union for support of that bipartisan bill and they did. They supported it, but they also just endorsed Donald Trump and said you‚Äôve been ‚Äúa failure with border security.‚Äù Why do you think they said that?

Kamala Harris :
I think they‚Äôre frustrated and I get it. They want support. They want support, and that‚Äôs what that border security bill would‚Äôve done. These guys down at the border, these men and women, they‚Äôre working hard. They‚Äôre working around the clock. I get it.

Bret Baier :
There‚Äôs a lot of people that look back at what you said in 2019 when you first ran for president. And there have been changes and you‚Äôve talked about some of them. When it comes to immigration, you supported allowing immigrants in the country illegally to apply for driver‚Äôs license, to qualify for free tuition at universities, to be enrolled in free healthcare. Do you still support those things?

Kamala Harris :
Listen, that was five years ago and I‚Äôm very clear that I will follow the law. I have made that statement over and over again and as vice president of the United States, that‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôve done, not to mention before.

Bret Baier :
If that‚Äôs the case, you chose a running mate, Tim Walz, governor of Minnesota, who signed those very things into state law. So do you support that?

Kamala Harris :
We are very clear and I am very clear, as is Tim Walz, that we must support and enforce federal law and that is exactly what we will do.

Bret Baier :
Decriminalizing border crossings, like you said in 2019-

Kamala Harris :
I do not believe in decriminalizing border crossings and I‚Äôve not done that as vice president. I will not do that as president.

Bret Baier :
So these are evolutions that you‚Äôve had.

Kamala Harris :
Well, let‚Äôs be very clear. I‚Äôm the only person who‚Äôs running for president who has prosecuted transnational criminal organizations, from the Sinaloa Cartel, to the Guadalajara Cartel, to people who have trafficked in guns, drugs and human beings. I have spent a significant part of my career going after people who present a threat to the safety of the American people and cross our border with the intent of doing us harm and cross our border illegally. And I will do that work as vice president, I take that work quite seriously.

Bret Baier :
This is a time when voters, especially here in Pennsylvania, are inundated with commercials and ads. They just want it to stop because it‚Äôs every commercial. But many of them add noise, but a few of them seem to break through. This particular one from the Trump campaign has gotten a lot of attention.

Speaker 4 (Trump Ad) :
Kamala supports taxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners.
Kamala Harris (Trump Ad) :
‚ÄúFor prisoners. Every transgender inmate in the prison system would have access‚Äù

Bret Baier :
So are you still in support of using taxpayer dollars to help prison inmates or detained illegal aliens to transition to another gender?

Kamala Harris :
I will follow the law and it‚Äôs a law that Donald Trump actually followed. You‚Äôre probably familiar with now it‚Äôs a public report that under Donald Trump‚Äôs administration, these surgeries were available to, on a medical necessity basis, to people in the federal prison system. And I think frankly, that ad from the Trump campaign is a little bit of like throwing stones when you‚Äôre living in a glass house.

Bret Baier :
The Trump aides say that he never advocated for that prison policy and no gender transition surgeries happened during his presidency.

Kamala Harris :
Well, you got to take responsible for what happened in your administration.

Bret Baier :
Yeah, no surgeries happened in his presidency.

Kamala Harris :
It‚Äôs in black and white.

Bret Baier :
Would you still advocate for using taxpayer dollars for gender reassignment surgeries?

Kamala Harris :
I would follow the law, just as-

Bret Baier :
Well, you have a say in as-

Kamala Harris :
‚Ä¶ I think Donald Trump would say he did.

Bret Baier :
You would have a say as president.

Kamala Harris :
Like I said, I think it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ He spent $20 million on those ads trying to create a sense of fear in the voters because he actually has no plan in this election that is about focusing on the needs of the American people. Whereas $20 million on that ad, on an issue that, as it relates to the biggest issues that affect the American people, it‚Äôs really quite remote. And again, his policy was no different. Look at where we are though.

Bret Baier :
They say it was different, but let‚Äôs, we‚Äôll move on.

Kamala Harris :
On plans for the American people, I‚Äôm offering a plan to deal with affordable housing. I‚Äôm offering a plan to deal with what we need to do to strengthen small businesses which are the backbone of America‚Äôs economy. I am offering a plan that is about taking care of young parents and giving them the support they need. My plans for the economy will strengthen the economy, as have been reviewed by 16 Nobel Laureates, Goldman Sachs, Moody‚Äôs, and recently the Wall Street Journal, which have all studied our plans and have indicated my plans for our economy would strengthen our economy. His would make them weaker, would ignite-

Bret Baier :
Why do you think more people say-

Kamala Harris :
‚Ä¶ inflation and invite a recession by the middle of next year. Those are the facts.

Bret Baier :
Why do you think more people say they trust him on the economy than they trust you?

Kamala Harris :
I think that when you look at an analysis of our plans for what we would do as president of the United States, it has been clear to those who study and understand how economic policy works that moving forward, because I do believe the American people are ready to turn the page on the divisiveness and the type of rhetoric that has come out of Donald Trump, people are ready to chart a new way forward and they want a president who has a plan for the future and a plan that is sound and will strengthen our country. My plan for the economy does exactly that. His plan would be again to give tax cuts to billionaires and the biggest corporations in our country and blow up our deficit.

Bret Baier :
It‚Äôs interesting you said turn the page, Madam Vice President. You were asked on two different shows last week, what, if anything, you would do differently than President Biden? Here‚Äôs what you said.

Speaker 6 (prior interview) :
Would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?
Kamala Harris (prior interview) :
‚ÄúThere is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of‚Ä¶ And I‚Äôve been a part of most of the decisions that have had impact‚Äù
Stephen Colbert (prior interview) :
Under a Harris administration, what would the major changes be? And what would stay the same?
Kamala Harris (prior interview) :
‚ÄúSure. Well, I‚Äôm obviously not Joe Biden‚Äù
Stephen Colbert (prior interview) :
I noticed. 
Kamala Harris (prior interview) :
‚ÄúSo that would be one change in terms of‚Ä¶ But also, I think it‚Äôs important to say with 28 days to go, I‚Äôm not Donald Trump‚Äù

Bret Baier :
So you‚Äôre not Joe Biden, you‚Äôre not Donald Trump, but nothing comes to mind that you would do differently?

Kamala Harris :
Let me be very clear. My presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden‚Äôs presidency. And like every new president that comes into office, I will bring my life experiences, my professional experiences, and fresh and new ideas. I represent a new generation of leadership.I, for example, am someone who has not spent the majority of my career in Washington D.C. I invite ideas, whether it be from the Republicans who are supporting me, who were just on stage with me minutes ago, and the business sector and others who can contribute to the decisions that I make about, for example, my plan for increasing the supply of housing in America and bringing down the cost of housing, addressing the issue of small businesses, which is about working with the private sector to bring more capital and access to capital to our small business leaders, including my plan for a $25,000 down payment assistance for first-time home buyers and for small businesses, extending the tax deduction from $5,000 to $50,000.

Bret Baier :
We‚Äôve heard a lot about those plans in recent days. Your campaign slogan is a new way forward and it‚Äôs time to turn the page. You‚Äôve been vice president for three and a half years, so what are you turning the page from?

Kamala Harris :
Well, first of all, turning the page from the last decade in which we have been burdened with the kind of rhetoric coming from Donald Trump that has been designed and implemented to divide our country and have Americans literally point fingers at each other. Rhetoric and an approach to leadership that suggests that the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down instead of what we all know, the strength of leadership is based on who you lift up.

Bret Baier :
But you, Madam Vice President-

Kamala Harris :
The strength of an American president, which is one who understands that the vast majority of us have more in common than what separates us. That is turning the page-

Bret Baier :
Madam Vice President, more than 70% of people tell pollsters-

Kamala Harris :
That is about turning the page on rhetoric that people are frankly exhausted of, Bret. People are exhausted.

Bret Baier :
More than 70% of people tell the country is on the wrong track. They say the country is on the wrong track. If it‚Äôs on the wrong track, that track follows three and a half years of you being vice president and President Biden being president. That is what they‚Äôre saying, 79% of them. Why are they saying that? If you‚Äôre turning the page, you‚Äôve been in office for three and a half years.

Kamala Harris :
And Donald Trump has been running for office since-

Bret Baier :
But you‚Äôve been the person holding the office.

Kamala Harris :
Come on, come on.

Bret Baier :
Madam Vice President-

Kamala Harris :
You and I both know what I‚Äôm talking about. You and I both know what I‚Äôm talking about.

Bret Baier :
I actually don‚Äôt. What are you talking about?

Kamala Harris :
What I‚Äôm talking about is that over the last decade, people have become-

Bret Baier :
But you‚Äôre the lever of power.

Kamala Harris :
But listen, over the last decade, it is clear to me and certainly the Republicans who are on stage with me, the former chief of staff to the President Donald Trump, former defense secretaries, national security adviser and his vice president, one, that he is unfit to serve, that he is unstable, that he is dangerous, and that people are exhausted with someone who professes to be a leader who spends full-time demeaning and engaging in personal grievances and it being about him instead of-

Bret Baier :
Madam Vice President-

Kamala Harris :
‚Ä¶ instead the American people.

Bret Baier :
‚Ä¶ if that‚Äôs the case-

Kamala Harris :
People are tired of that.

Bret Baier :
If that‚Äôs the case, why is half the country supporting him? Why is he beating you in a lot of swing states? Why, if he‚Äôs as bad as you say, that half of this country is now supporting this person who could be the 47th president of the United States? Why is that happening?

Kamala Harris :
This is an election for president of the United States. It‚Äôs not supposed to be easy.

Bret Baier :
I know, but it is-

Kamala Harris :
It is not supposed to be a cakewalk for anyone.

Bret Baier :
So are they misguided, the 50%?

Kamala Harris :
Listen, let-

Bret Baier :
Are they stupid? What is it?

Kamala Harris :
Oh, God. I would never say that about the American people. And in fact, if you listen to Donald Trump, if you watch any of his rallies, he‚Äôs the one who tends to demean and belittle and diminish the American people. He‚Äôs the one who talks about an enemy within, an enemy within, talking about the American people, suggesting he would turn the American military on the American people.

Bret Baier :
We asked that question to the former president today. Harris Faulkner had a town hall and this is how he responded.

Donald Trump (town hall) :
‚ÄúI heard about that. They were saying I was threatening. I‚Äôm not threatening anybody. They‚Äôre the ones doing the threatening. They do phony investigations. I‚Äôve been investigated more than Alphonse Capone. He was the greatest gangster-‚Äú
Harris Faulkner (town hall) :
Oh my goodness.
Donald Trump (town hall) :
‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs true‚Äù
Harris Faulkner (town hall) :
All right. 
Donald Trump (town hall) :
‚ÄúBut think of it. It‚Äôs called weaponization of government. It‚Äôs a terrible thing‚Äù

Kamala Harris :
Bret, I‚Äôm sorry, and with all due respect, that clip was not what he has been saying about the enemy within, that he has repeated when he‚Äôs speaking about the American people. That‚Äôs not what you just showed.

Bret Baier :
Well, he was asked about that specific-

Kamala Harris :
No, no, no. That‚Äôs not what you just showed, in all fairness-

Bret Baier :
No, no, no.

Kamala Harris :
‚Ä¶ and respect to you.

Bret Baier :
I‚Äôm telling you that was the question that we asked him.

Kamala Harris :
You didn‚Äôt show that and here‚Äôs the bottom line. He has repeated it many times and you and I both know that. And you and I both know that he has talked about turning the American military on the American people. He has talked about going after people who are engaged in peaceful protest. He has talked about locking people up because they disagree with him.This is a democracy and in a democracy, the president of the United States, in the United States of America should be willing to be able to handle criticism without saying he‚Äôd lock people up for doing it. And this is what is at stake, which is why you have someone like the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff saying what Mark Milley has said about Donald Trump being a threat to the United States of America.

Bret Baier :
He‚Äôs quoted in the Bob Woodward book that way, yes. Let me ask you this, Madam Vice President.

Kamala Harris :
But let‚Äôs not-

Bret Baier :
You call Donald Trump-

Kamala Harris :
‚Ä¶ diminish the significance of that.

Bret Baier :
You call Donald Trump, he‚Äôs misguided. You say now he‚Äôs-

Kamala Harris :
He‚Äôs unstable.

Bret Baier :
‚Ä¶ unstable.

Kamala Harris :
He is unstable, Bret.

Bret Baier :
He‚Äôs not well, you say he is mentally not stable.

Kamala Harris :
He‚Äôs not stable.

Bret Baier :
Let me ask you this.

Kamala Harris :
And we should all be concerned.

Bret Baier :
You told many interviewers that Joe Biden was on his game, that ran around circles on his staff. When did you first notice that President Biden‚Äôs mental faculties appeared diminished?

Kamala Harris :
Joe Biden, I have watched in from the Oval Office to the situation room, and he has the judgment and experience to do exactly what he has done in making very important decisions on behalf of the American people. Joe Biden-

Bret Baier :
There were no concerns raised?

Kamala Harris :
Bret, Joe Biden is not on ballot.

Bret Baier :
I understand, but-

Kamala Harris :
And Donald Trump is-

Bret Baier :
But you talked about it.

Kamala Harris :
And Donald Trump is.

Bret Baier :
After George Clooney said within a few minutes of-

Kamala Harris :
And if you watch Donald Trump-

Bret Baier :
‚Ä¶ talking to President Biden at a fundraiser, that he thought this was not the same Joe Biden that we saw on the debate stage.

Kamala Harris :
Donald Trump is on the ballot.

Bret Baier :
I understand. You met with him at least once a week for three and a half years. You didn‚Äôt have any concerns?

Kamala Harris :
I think the American people have a concern about Donald Trump, which is why the people who know him best, including leaders of our national security community, have all spoken out. Even people who worked for him in the Oval Office, worked with him in the situation room, and have said he is unfit and dangerous and should never be president of the United States again, including his former vice president, which is why the job was open for him to choose another running mate. So that is a fact. That is a fact.

Bret Baier :
Madam Vice President, two more things. You were asked on 60 Minutes about the biggest threat that the world faces, that the US faces. This is what you said.

Bill Whitaker (prior interview) :
Which foreign country do you consider to be our greatest adversary?
Kamala Harris (prior interview):
I think there‚Äôs an obvious one in mind, which is Iran. Iran has American blood on their hands. Okay? This attack on Israel, 200 ballistic missiles. What we need to do to ensure that Iran never achieves the ability to be a nuclear power, that is one of my highest priorities.

Bret Baier :
A number of experts thought you would say China, the FBI director had said that, but you said Iran. If that‚Äôs the case, what do you say to critics who look at the actions of your administration and say you‚Äôre not acting like Iran is the number one threat?

Kamala Harris :
Well, I will tell you most recently, whether it was in April or in October, and then several hours on each occasion, that Iran posed a threat to Israel. I was there, most recently in the situation room in the most recent attack, working with the heads of our military in doing what America must always do to defend and to support Israel in its requirement to defend itself and to give American support, to be able to allow Israel to have the resources to defend itself against attack, including from Iran and Iran‚Äôs terrorist proxies in the region.

Bret Baier :
Right.

Kamala Harris :
And that is-

Bret Baier :
But those proxies were getting funded by Iran.

Kamala Harris :
And my commitment to that is unyielding and unwavering.

Bret Baier :
Critics just say that you either relaxed or failed to enforce sanctions on Iran, allowing all of this money to flow into Iran, like billions in oil profits.

Kamala Harris :
But let‚Äôs go back to Donald Trump, who-

Bret Baier :
Hold on, that-

Kamala Harris :
‚Ä¶ pulled out of a deal that would‚Äôve actually put Iran in check.

Bret Baier :
The estimate‚Äôs in billions.

Kamala Harris :
And then it was during Donald Trump‚Äôs administration that Iran-

Bret Baier :
‚Ä¶ that go towards the Iran regime.

Kamala Harris :
That we had an American military base that was attacked, where American soldiers suffered traumatic brain injuries and Donald Trump dismissed them as headaches. Not to mention how Donald Trump has-

Bret Baier :
Madame Vice President, all of this money-

Kamala Harris :
‚Ä¶ treated and talked about-

Bret Baier :
‚Ä¶ that has gone in the past few years-

Kamala Harris :
‚Ä¶ America‚Äôs military and military service people, calling-

Bret Baier :
Critics say-

Kamala Harris :
‚Ä¶ them suckers and losers.

Bret Baier :
‚Ä¶ that it goes to Hezbollah, Hamas, and Houthis.

Kamala Harris :
Has diminished the significance-

Bret Baier :
We‚Äôre talking over each other, I apologize.

Kamala Harris :
Well, and I wish-

Bret Baier :
But you‚Äôre not-

Kamala Harris :
I would like that we would have a conversation that is grounded in full assessment of the facts, which includes, I think this interview is supposed to be about the choices that your viewers should be presented about this election and the contrast is important.

Bret Baier :
Yes, ma‚Äôam. And we-

Kamala Harris :
And on this subject of Iran, I am offering what should be an important contrast that is presented for folks to make a decision that they feel-

Bret Baier :
And there are critics who look at what the administration did and think differently. Madam Vice President, they‚Äôre wrapping me very hard here. I hope you got to say what you wanted to say about Donald Trump. There are a lot of things-

Kamala Harris :
There‚Äôs more to say. I have much more to say, actually.

Bret Baier :
There are a lot of things that people want to learn about you and your policies.

Kamala Harris :
Yes,

Bret Baier :
And that‚Äôs why we invited you her.

Kamala Harris :
I invite everyone to go to KamalaHarris.com and you will see that I have 80 pages of policies that are quite comprehensive and should be accessible to anyone who would like to read them. And it includes what I intend to do about affordable housing, what I intend to do about small businesses, what I intend to do to-

Bret Baier :
And that‚Äôs why we invited you here.

Kamala Harris :
‚Ä¶ strengthen our economy.

Bret Baier :
To see where you were in 2019 and where you are now.

Kamala Harris :
To support America‚Äôs military and ensure we have the most lethal and best fighting force in the world.

Bret Baier :
Madam Vice President, they‚Äôre giving me a hard wrap here.

Kamala Harris :
Well, I thank you for the time.

Bret Baier :
I thank you for the time.

Kamala Harris :
It‚Äôs good to meet you.

Bret Baier :
Thank you very much.

Kamala Harris :
Thank you.

 FACT ... Resident Biden is behind all the persecution of President Trump. Jack Smith. Leticia James, Fani Willis, all Alvin Bragg ALL met on multiple occasions with the Biden maladministration at the White House WHILE building their cases!



E. Jean Carroll was personally coached to bring charges against President Trump by none other than the publicly loudmouthed, and deranged Trump-hater George Conway and was personally financed by major Biden donors. It doesn't take a Ph.D. to figure out what's going on here.

I live in FL and recently moved, so I had to update my driver‚Äôs license and update my voter registration . I went to the DMV, handed over all my documents (birth certificate, social security card, proof of address), verified everything, took my photo, and answered the questions about voter registration on the keypad. They didn‚Äôt give me any forms to fill out‚Äîjust used the info I gave them for my license.

My new license came back fine, no issues. But when I checked my voter registration online to make sure everything was good‚Ä¶ The address was wrong. Instead of ‚Äústreet name DRIVE,‚Äù they had it as ‚Äústreet name CIRCLE,‚Äù and my zip code was off by one number. Which makes absolutely 0 logical sense how this could‚Äôve happened.

This mistake would‚Äôve prevented me from voting since the same thing happened to my dad and they turned him away because of the same issue.

I called to fix it, and while they updated the street name, they STILL didn‚Äôt fix my zip code. I can‚Äôt help but feel like this was done on purpose to trip people up and keep them from voting (especially with the current political climate they obviously are trying to do this on purpose considering who I am voting for)

I don‚Äôt think this is accidental I truly believe they are doing this on purpose to ‚Äúrig‚Äù it without it being obvious.

I feel like Vance has represented well, but i feel like Trump just gives more of the same and expects different results.  I have said repeatedly that if the guy was truly a patriot, he would keep his mouth shut, swallow his ego, and do nothing but talk policy and business.  That's how he wins the country because you can't argue with results.

Watching him talk makes me nauseous.  It's almost as bad as listening to harris' quaking voice.

I live close to Pittsburgh but I have camps in rural pa.  I noticed a shift from Trump in 16 to Biden in 20 and now back to Trump in 24.  What is it that other people see in him as a president?  I was voting for Trump all along.  So what is it that the flip flippers are voting for now?

It almost seems like there‚Äôs a team of people or bots trying to make it look like everyone agrees with the video‚Äôs sentiment.

I spend a fair amount of time in YouTube comment sections, and I‚Äôve never seen so many generic comments like ‚Äúkeep posting‚Äù or ‚Äúgreat post‚Äù ‚Äî they feel super fake. Has anyone else noticed this, and does anyone have tips on how to figure out if these accounts leaving these kinds of comments are fake?
