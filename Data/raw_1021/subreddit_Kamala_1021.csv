Here's this script:

An inexperienced young male boxer hitting pads for the first time.

**Narrator**

‚ÄúIf you start boxing today, would you expect to win a world title this year?‚Äù

*The boxer spars and loses badly.*

**Narrator**

‚ÄúWould you expect to dominate without experience?‚Äù

*The boxer ditches practices to go drinking with his friends.*

**Narrator**

‚ÄúWould you expect to win without showing up?‚Äù

*Cut to a picture of Donald Trump.*

**Narrator**

‚ÄúSo why would you believe that Donald Trump created the world‚Äôs greatest economy in less than a year? When he had no idea what he was doing?‚Äù

*Cut to a relevant picture, infographic, or headline.*

**Narrator**

‚ÄúWhen his tax plan added five trillion to our national debt?‚Äù

*Cut to another relevant picture, infographic, or headline.*

**Narrator**

‚ÄúWhen he pulled us out of trade deals that ultimately pushed our partners toward China?‚Äù

*Cut to another relevant picture, infographic or headline.*

**Narrator**

‚ÄúWas our pre-Covid economy really built by Trump?‚Äù

*Cut back to the young boxer, working harder on the pads.*

**Narrator**

‚ÄúOr was it built by years of boring fundamentals?‚Äù

*Cut to Obama talking with citizens.*

**Narrator**

‚ÄúYears of investments to infrastructure, education, and the American people?‚Äù

*Cut to Kamala shaking hands with world leaders.*

**Narrator**

‚ÄúYears of building American trust around the world?‚Äù

*Back to the boxer training.*

**Narrator**

‚ÄúGood things take time. And we aren‚Äôt going back.‚Äù

Message: Vote Kamala Harris.

END SCRIPT.

**Why will this ad work?**

1. Boxing appeals to masculine men. For masculine men, peer pressure to support Trump is very intense. Using a story relatable to masculine men can relieve some of that pressure, causing many would-be Trump voters to stay home.
2. Uses an emotional, unexpected, and engaging analogy to drive home the point: Trump doesn‚Äôt deserve credit for the strong pre-Covid economy.
3. Encourages smart independents to take a closer look into the details, revealing major holes in Trump‚Äôs economic claims.
4. Gives concrete examples of Trump‚Äôs policy failures, challenging a common Trump-voter rhetoric: ‚ÄúI vote on policy, not scandal.‚Äù
5. Even if Kamala loses, this ad will plant seeds for the future in case Trump takes credit for Biden‚Äôs economic momentum.",3,1,JimmyGreyArea,Kamala,2024-10-10 09:15:57+00:00,0.67,/r/Kamala/comments/1g0ep9x/i_have_a_winning_kamala_campaign_commercial/,False
