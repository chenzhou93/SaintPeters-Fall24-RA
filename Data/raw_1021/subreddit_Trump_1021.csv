1g9505w,My Daughter is Voting for…,https://i.redd.it/79a8w3l9a7wd1.jpeg,"So my daughter knows I lean conservative and I’m pro 2A, pro life and pro freedom. She is 21 and this will be the first election she can vote in. Up until yesterday she was undecided. She has a few friends in the “trans” community and of course most folks her age are as far left as they come. Over her young life she has always taken a logical approach to things and although she knows how I’m voting I have made it clear that she is free to vote for whomever she feels will best align with her own values which to be honest kinda scared the crap outta me because her liberal mother had a heavy influence on her life.

Well, she came to me and said proudly “Dad I know who I’m going to vote for and here’s why. One side is full of hate and that is their primary motivation. They are only driven by hatred of the other candidate, but the other candidate’s supporters are voting for someone instead of voting against someone, so for that reason I’m voting for Trump.”

Honestly half way through her explanation I thought she was going to tell me it was Kamala because the media continues to push a message of hate and fear and I thought she was parroting that. I’m so thankful she arrived at the conclusion she did on her own!",43,7,Montrosaur,trump,2024-10-22 00:14:59+00:00,0.91,/r/trump/comments/1g9505w/my_daughter_is_voting_for/,FALSE

1g91dny,Trump supporters are you worried about Trump's cognitive decline and Vance stepping in?  ,https://www.reddit.com/r/trump/comments/1g91dny/trump_supporters_are_you_worried_about_trumps/,"My sister and I keep talking about how Trump's behavior reminds us exactly of how our late dad was when he was going into cognitive decline at age 80. Trump is 78.  It's hard to watch.  Is anyone concerned about this?  Vance would definitely have to take over before the end of four years and he has very little experience, especially with dealing with world leaders.  Everyone really has to consider that you are really voting for Vance at this point and how you feel about that.  I know little about him except he parrots whatever Trump says and he wrote the forward to the book that Project 2025 is based on, which does not sit well with me after reading through it this weekend.  It's crazy frankly.  His support of project 2025 would dismantle the Dept of Education, Social Security, protections around health insurance, such as preexisting conditions, and the ability to do away with the protections around our constitution, no overtime pay any longer.....and that's only the beginning.  It's a playbook for a dictatorship versus a democracy and could be our last chance to vote possibly ever...so you better be damned sure.  Trump can claim distance from project 2025 (although his name is mentioned over 300 times in it) but Vance has openly discussed it before his VP days when he wasn't allowed any longer to mention it.  Like I said, he wrote the forward to the book!  Publishing of the project 2025-inspired book was held off till post-election date.  Lots to consider here.  He's against people being childless so what happens if my kid chooses that path.  Will she have fewer rights or opportunities if she has no kids?  So much to consider.

* According to FiveThirtyEight's averages, since June 30, Harris' favorability rating has increased by over fifteen points from -16.3 to -0.7.

# The Spin

# Democratic narrative

Trump's hateful post-truth propaganda attempts to divide the American people in the pursuit of power. Such polarizing behavior is unbecoming of a candidate seeking to become president and goes against the very values of the country he seeks to lead. Seeing himself as an unchallengeable authority and hellbent on stoking societal tensions, Trump must be stopped from returning to the White House at all costs.

[The Gonzaga Bulletin](https://www.gonzagabulletin.com/opinion/trump-s-hateful-rhetoric-and-the-threat-to-democratic-values/article_79c8f9c0-8b4f-11ef-a9b9-9f82569f634d.html)

It is no surprise that the Democratic campaign is losing momentum — Harris is an unpopular and unimpressive candidate forced upon the American people by the establishment elite. Having failed at the first hurdle during her 2020 presidential bid before undertaking one of the least successful tenures as Vice President in American history, it's laughable that Democrats expect the public to believe it is Trump, and not Harris, who is unfit for office.

1g9505w,My Daughter is Voting for…,https://i.redd.it/79a8w3l9a7wd1.jpeg,"So my daughter knows I lean conservative and I’m pro 2A, pro life and pro freedom. She is 21 and this will be the first election she can vote in. Up until yesterday she was undecided. She has a few friends in the “trans” community and of course most folks her age are as far left as they come. Over her young life she has always taken a logical approach to things and although she knows how I’m voting I have made it clear that she is free to vote for whomever she feels will best align with her own values which to be honest kinda scared the crap outta me because her liberal mother had a heavy influence on her life.

Well, she came to me and said proudly “Dad I know who I’m going to vote for and here’s why. One side is full of hate and that is their primary motivation. They are only driven by hatred of the other candidate, but the other candidate’s supporters are voting for someone instead of voting against someone, so for that reason I’m voting for Trump.”

Honestly half way through her explanation I thought she was going to tell me it was Kamala because the media continues to push a message of hate and fear and I thought she was parroting that. I’m so thankful she arrived at the conclusion she did on her own!",43,7,Montrosaur,trump,2024-10-22 00:14:59+00:00,0.91,/r/trump/comments/1g9505w/my_daughter_is_voting_for/,False

Trump is 78.  It's hard to watch.  Is anyone concerned about this?  Vance would definitely have to take over before the end of four years and he has very little experience, especially with dealing with world leaders.  Everyone really has to consider that you are really voting for Vance at this point and how you feel about that.  I know little about him except he parrots whatever Trump says and he wrote the forward to the book that Project 2025 is based on, which does not sit well with me after reading through it this weekend.  It's crazy frankly.  His support of project 2025 would dismantle the Dept of Education, Social Security, protections around health insurance, such as preexisting conditions, and the ability to do away with the protections around our constitution, no overtime pay any longer.....and that's only the beginning.  It's a playbook for a dictatorship versus a democracy and could be our last chance to vote possibly ever...so you better be damned sure.  Trump can claim distance from project 2025 (although his name is mentioned over 300 times in it) but Vance has openly discussed it before his VP days when he wasn't allowed any longer to mention it.  Like I said, he wrote the forward to the book!  Publishing of the project 2025-inspired book was held off till post-election date.  Lots to consider here.  He's against people being childless so what happens if my kid chooses that path.  Will she have fewer rights or opportunities if she has no kids?  So much to consider.

* According to FiveThirtyEight's averages, since June 30, Harris' favorability rating has increased by over fifteen points from -16.3 to -0.7.

# The Spin

# Democratic narrative

Trump's hateful post-truth propaganda attempts to divide the American people in the pursuit of power. Such polarizing behavior is unbecoming of a candidate seeking to become president and goes against the very values of the country he seeks to lead. Seeing himself as an unchallengeable authority and hellbent on stoking societal tensions, Trump must be stopped from returning to the White House at all costs.

[The Gonzaga Bulletin](https://www.gonzagabulletin.com/opinion/trump-s-hateful-rhetoric-and-the-threat-to-democratic-values/article_79c8f9c0-8b4f-11ef-a9b9-9f82569f634d.html)

It is no surprise that the Democratic campaign is losing momentum — Harris is an unpopular and unimpressive candidate forced upon the American people by the establishment elite. Having failed at the first hurdle during her 2020 presidential bid before undertaking one of the least successful tenures as Vice President in American history, it's laughable that Democrats expect the public to believe it is Trump, and not Harris, who is unfit for office.

So if we have all been laughing at her (i'm British) i'm sure other peoples, leaders have also laughed along with us. 

Lets face facts, she got the VP job for 2 reasons, she's black and she is a woman, if she was white and a man she wouldn't have got within a bajillion miles of the most powerful job on the planet and how does she go from a Global laughing stock to being respected and seen as a leader who will do everything to end war (Trump Policy) ban tax on tips (Trump policy), get tougher on the wall and border security (Trump policy) and be anything other than a toothless World leader who can be manipulated as everyone knows Obama will be pulling the strings.

I'm not and never have been racist or a misogenious man, my own children and of mixed heritage but the ONLY reason she got VP was because shes black-ish (lol) and a woman, thats her credentials for the Oval Office.

1g7zm6d,And old friend ditched me over my support for Trump!,https://www.reddit.com/r/trump/comments/1g7zm6d/and_old_friend_ditched_me_over_my_support_for/,"I tried contacting an old friend today. We have not spoken to each other in a decade. She right off the bat asked me about what I thought about Trump. I was not looking to get into politics right away. We have always been on opposite sides, me being Libertarian, and see an avowed Socialist.

I would like to think that I can be friends with anyone, regards of political affiliation. That used to be the case, but not anymore.

The leftist media has been very busy spreading vicious lies about Trump. Early on I checked out every claim they made and have found them to be FALSE. EVERY SINGLE ONE.

So I support Trump. I want to see Trump win in 2024, and will be sending in my ballot shortly. And if someone wants to defriend me for my support, so be it.

Trump 2024.

===============================

I decided to post my former friend's response here. To say this is vitriolic is the understatement of the millennium. Prepare yourself for a peek into the mind of someone thunderstruck with TDS. It is not pretty.

>*I honestly can't speak to you anymore. Trump is slime, a con artist, a rapist, and a traitor who licks Putin's ass. Anyone who loves him is also a traitor and deeply stupid for falling for his act.*

  
She knows me better than this. She knows that I am hyper-rational, critical thinker who checks things out.

>*He has outright told us he plans to replace all non-partisans working in government with loyalists and that he'll be a dictator on day one.*

Trump never said that, of course. And all presidents tend to replace people in the bureaucracy with their friends. Nothing new there.

>*His cultists are warming to the idea, and are now saying it's time for us to have a dictator. He loves Hitler, and wants to be the next one.*

I truly don´t know where she gets this stuff from. She was not this bad 10 years ago.

>*And if you think anyone with your skin color will be safe in his America, you are sadly mistaken. He says he plans to round up not just illegal, but also legal immigrants in internment camps,*

Oh, right into the Race FUDding crap. Probably because more blacks than ever support Trump. But she is buying this rhetoric hook, line, and sinker. She is not the same person I knew.

>*and calls all non-white countries ""shithole countries,"" so good luck getting your wife over here.*

I married a girl in Colombia, and will have no problems with that if we decide to do that. I know the procedure, as I did it once before. But my wife doesn´t really want to live in the US anyway. Europe would be a better choice, overall, for a number of reasons. But that's not something I will discuss here. And he never said that all ""non-white"" countries are shitholes.

>*He'll make sure all women's bodies are state-owned property, and under him, not only will abortion be illegal, but so will birth control for women. I'm sorry, but goodbye.*

My word. This sounds like it was ripped right of of Kamala's playbook.

There is no way to reason with that. TDS big time. And not worth my time at all. All lies, propaganda, and spin-doctoring. Now that I've had the chance to go over what she said more closely, the feeling is mutual. Not my friend. Good riddance. Yuck.

1g6n8mj,Kamala Voter Meltdown,https://www.reddit.com/r/trump/comments/1g6n8mj/kamala_voter_meltdown/,"Last night I was at a Panera Bread in Lancaster, PA, a marginally red county that has seen an influx of NY and NJ people moving in and taking their politics with them. 
Two of the three kiosks were broken and the line at the counter was long. A couple and their children were standing at the electronic kiosk flipping though the menu over and over again like their life depends on which sandwich they are going to order from Panera. They were completely oblivious to the line of people forming behind them. One lady literally left the store.
After about 10 minutes of this nonsense I started to think about how entitled these people were and how they must be Democrats. My blood was boiling but I don’t like confrontation so I bit my lip. Finally they finish, but one of their kids parks her ass in front of the kiosk. I simply reach over the kid and start typing my order.
“You couldn’t wait until we finished,” the mother said. “You have got to be kidding me,” I replied. “You people think you are the only people in the world,” I continued. After she became irate and said something else to me I simply replied and said, I can tell you are a couple of Harris Voters.” With a red angry lib face she replied, “Damn straight we are you Trumper!”

Harris voters can be identified easily because they are assholes. They are the people in the left lane doing 47MPH who won’t move over. They block the grocery store aisle with their cart. Yes, they’ll even treat a chain restaurant as if they own the place. 

It is not just about voting FOR Trump. It is about beating these people and sending them into a mental health crisis. They all deserve it.
