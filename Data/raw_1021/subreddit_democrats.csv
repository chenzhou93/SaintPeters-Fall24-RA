With the current state of the House of Representatives and with the unknown, legal, and suspicious tricks and lies that the House of Representatives and the Republican Party and billionaires supporting Trump might have up their sleeves, we need to take this seriously and not allow this to happen. Everyone, we must vote blue in this election and in the Representative Elections too

1g91nft,"I want something to vote FOR, not just against. Here are two ideas‚Ä¶",https://i.redd.it/d4o37wuoi6wd1.jpeg,"Idea 1: A policy proposal to incentivize keeping manufacturing and service operations US-based. 

The Premise: Corporations acting at the expense of their workforce increases the taxpayer burden to provide for these employees in areas such as welfare, public assistance, social services, and crime prevention and law enforcement. This plan shifts the burden back to the corporations. 

The Plan: 
Maintain or lower the corporate tax rate, currently at around 21%.
 
-For each corporation, increase their tax rate 1% for each 1% of their adult workforce earning below the federally-defined poverty level. 

-For each corporation, increase their tax rate 1% for each 1% of their global workforce that serves US customers (through manufacturing or customer service) that is based outside of the US. 

-Allow exemptions for small businesses and locally owned restaurants with five or fewer locations, but ensure these exemptions cannot become loopholes for large corporations (Walmart or McDonalds should not be able to classify each individual store as a small business, etc). 
 

Idea 2: Create a national Civil Service Corps similar to a branch of the military. This country has many well-meaning young people who want a way to earn a living while serving their country, but for whom the military is not the right use for their talents or ambitions. 

The CSC can deploy members to high-need areas such as serving the homeless and putting them on a path to independence, assisting in high-need schools, running after school programs, elder care, etc. 

Members would have a rank (officers and enlisted, depending on level of education and training). They are eligible for federal benefits and salary, so long as the leadership sends (‚Äúdeploys‚Äù) them to an area where they are needed to serve. 

‚Äî‚Äî-
Though I am a never-Trumper and am definitely voting blue on my entire ticket, seeing grand, hopeful, aspirational policy proposals such as this one would give me massive levels of excitement.

The Harris campaign is touting a list of endorsements from more than 70 tribal leaders across Indian Country; roughly a fourth of them are from Arizona.


So far, at least 17 elected officials from nearly half of the state‚Äôs 22 federally recognized tribes have personally backed the Harris-Walz ticket, both publicly and privately to the campaign, but not on behalf of their governments.


These include representatives from the Navajo Nation, Tohono O‚Äôodham Nation, Colorado River Indian Tribes, Gila River Indian Community, Kaibab Paiute Tribe, San Juan Southern Paiute Tribe, Ak-Chin Indian Community, Pueblo of Zuni, Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community and San Carlos Apache Tribe.


But the latter is the sole exception in Arizona. 
In a rare show of support, the San Carlos Apache Tribal Council officially endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz after unanimously passing a resolution back in August.

He‚Äôs a guy in his mid-20s from Mississippi originally and works in Atlanta now. We talked for about 30 min while he was driving and I had a genuine connection with him while he was explaining what was most important to him. The economy was a big point, he didn‚Äôt like how the top 1% has benefitted from so many policies (Trump‚Äôs tax cuts absolutely fueled this). He was also disappointed with the Jan 6 attempted coup and abortion bans in the south. He doesn‚Äôt necessarily buy into the ‚Äúdoom and gloom‚Äù messaging on the left, which I didn‚Äôt want to push because I wanted to keep the convo going, and we left with him leaning less towards trjmp and more undecided but very interested in reading more about each platform. We talked for awhile about my family and situation and what I felt would benefit the middle class by the Harris/Walz plan. Ultimately he‚Äôll make his own decision but I felt so refreshed from this call because he‚Äôs in the demographic we all see as ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù trumpies: young white men. I told him to tell all his friends to vote and he was eager to do so. I felt like if this was a troll, our call would not have lasted so long (27 min!). If you can, please volunteer to phone bank. There are a lot of people who hang up or are rude and that‚Äôs fine. I got this one caller and 10 others who gave me SO much hope.

I am new here but I've been a D my whole life. Yes, Nate Silver has gotten it wrong in the past but it even so most pollsters give trump the edge right now. 

What do Democrats need to be doing right now? We're down to the wire and I cannot even begin to fathom what will happen if trump actually pulls this off a second time.

My take is that Harris and Walz need to just stop talking about immigration, no matter what outlandish absurd claims trump spews. Whether it's right or wrong people are ready to believe the most idiotic things about immigrants. Stick to J6. Stick to abortion.

But what about the everyday voter? Where should we devote our time, money and effort? ",0,33,Otto_von_Bismuth,democrats,2024-10-21 15:45:17+00:00,0.41,/r/democrats/comments/1g8suan/how_is_this_happening_and_seriously_what_should/,False

It‚Äôs a strategy, described by several top campaign aides, with massive implications for the shape of the electorate. Between Harris‚Äô push on abortion and Trump‚Äôs growth with male voters ‚Äî especially young men ‚Äî pollsters on both sides of the aisle are predicting that 2024 will represent the largest chasm in vote preferences between the two sexes in modern political history.

There‚Äôs evidence from 2022 to back up the Harris campaign‚Äôs theory that she can improve her margins with women. Nationally, Democrats won women by 53 percent to Republicans‚Äô 45 percent. But in Michigan, where abortion played a central role not only in the governor‚Äôs race but in a ballot initiative to enshrine abortion rights in the state‚Äôs constitution, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer won women by 62 percent ‚Äî a 26-point gap over Republican Tudor Dixon.

So far, Harris is on track to expand those margins. An October New York Times/Siena College national poll found Harris winning 56 percent of the vote among women, with Trump earning just 40 percent ‚Äî a 16-point gap. And in 2020, Trump won two-thirds of white women without a college degree, a 27-point gap with Biden, according to exit polls. But Harris, according to a recent Marist College poll, has cut that advantage in half.

Democrats aren‚Äôt abandoning efforts to target men in this final stretch, but the Harris campaign‚Äôs strategy is designed to shore up support among moderate women who have long been the last-minute deciders in a tight presidential race. White women make up the largest percentage of the vote share ‚Äî at 38 percent nationally and 42 percent or more in priority states ‚Äî according to an analysis from Galvanize Action, a nonpartisan group that‚Äôs been surveying more than 6,000 white women across 10 battleground states since June.

1g8cmhd,Doomscrolling? Check this out to calm down,https://i.redd.it/bg0rh46k10wd1.jpeg,"Here are several points to calm yourself down!

1) The national polls were worse in 2012! The mainstream media constant reporting was that the economic recovery was lackluster and the average swing voter wanted a successful businessman to supercharge the economy. Your average news-obsessed Democrat believed there was a very good likelihood that Obama would lose, especially after the media crowned Romney as the big winner of the first debate. 

What about state polls? Pollsters were openly stating on cable news that Obama couldn‚Äôt win Florida. Pretty much no one thought the blue-wall would collapse, but Romney didn‚Äôt need that. Colorado and Virginia were brand new to the blue column, full of 2004 Bush voters that liked Romney. So if Romney took those three states plus Ohio, he would win the electoral college. If Romney won the popular vote by 6 points, like Gallup polled, he would easily win those states. I was not alone thinking that Obama was going to lose. 

2) There‚Äôs no substantial reason to think the polling error of 2020 will exactly repeat itself in 2024. People like to think the 2016 polls were all terribly wrong, the national polls were only 1.1% off! If they had adjusted for non-college educated voters, like polls do today, the national polls would have actually UNDERCOUNTED Hillary voters in 2016.

Again, there‚Äôs no scientific reason to say Trump always over performs the polls, it‚Äôs just a feeling people have. There‚Äôs even evidence to suggest it‚Äôs wrong because Trump consistently underperformed in the 2024 primary polls. It‚Äôs not conclusive but it certainly means such claims should be met with skepticism. 

It‚Äôs much more plausible to believe the best and most thorough pollsters, such as NYT/Siena, further modified their craft in 2022 and have the best pulse on the electorate compared to any other pollster. That 2020 was a pandemic election and Democratic-voters over-respond to polls during pandemics. 

3) If the polls were accurate in 2020, you‚Äôd have polls using their margin of error of 3 to 4 points in BOTH directions! So even though the final result was Biden 49.6% to Trump 48.9%, this is what ACCURATE polls WITHIN their margin of error would have looked like:

Emerson: 52% Trump over 46% Biden
Marquette: 50% Trump over 49% Biden
NYT/Siena: 50% Biden over 49% Trump
CNN: 51% Biden over 48% Trump

Could you imagine how people would have freaked out? Even though those polls would have been accurate and would end up with Biden victory. The polls we have today are much better than that! 

4) Some of the best non-partisan state-level pollsters, like SurveyUSA, have sat out most of this election. Almost all the state-level polls have been from Trump-connected pollsters. If you are running a Trump-connected polling organization, and all the other Trump-connected pollsters are showing him gaining‚Ä¶.you better make sure your polls mirror that or you are going to lose all your future business if you show Trump losing and Trump ends up winning. That‚Äôs almost certainly why IPP had their +4 Harris poll of register voters out of Pennsylvania magically turn into a Trump lead when they applied a radical Likely voter methodology. 

5) The best 2022 pollsters of the 3 easiest key states to victory (Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan) are showing a Harris lead. Let‚Äôs look at 2022:

In 2022:
NYT/Siena had Shapiro winning by 13%, Shapiro won by 14.5%
	Had Fetterman winning by 5%, Fetterman win by 5%
Siena had Johnson (R-Wisconsin) winning by 2%, he won by 1%
	Had Evers (D-WI Gov) winning by 2%, he won by 3.5%
Marquette had Johnson winning by 2%, he won by 1%
	Had Evers tied, he won by 3.5%

Marquette and NYT/Siena were both very accurate and had a REPUBLICAN lean in 2022. 

What are these two pollsters saying about 2024:

NTY/Siena had has two major polls of Pennsylvania and BOTH polls had +4 Harris lead

NYT/Siena latest poll has Harris leading Trump by one in Michigan

NYT/Siena latest poll has Harris leading Trump by +2 in Wisconsin

Marquette, the golden standard in Wisconsin polls, has Harris +4 in Wisconsin

5) Harris doesn‚Äôt just win if the polls are underestimating Democrats, she ALSO wins if the best pollsters are accurate. 

6) There‚Äôs actually lots of things I can‚Äôt get into that can positively affect Harris, but I‚Äôll list some:

A) Early vote is going +10 female
B) With much less mail vote this year, women can more easily hide their vote from their husbands
C) Harris has an actual ground game, we haven‚Äôt seen a ground game like this since 2012
D) The Musk ground game may be the biggest bust in GOP history
E) Early vote is going the best in PA and MI, which is exactly what we want (WI hasn‚Äôt started their early vote in person yet)
F) Harris has way more money
G) Harris leads Trump in favor ability by a good margin, which makes late-breaking voters more likely to go her way than Clinton
H) Ho-boy my fingers are getting tired, you get the idea! Now stop being all doom and gloom!

1g7z1g7,HELP! My bf isn‚Äôt worried about things that matter. What do I do? ,https://store.kamalaharris.com/harris-walz-yard-sign/,"HELP! My bf isn‚Äôt worried about things that matter. What do I do? 

Hi, I need to know what others think of this situation so I can gain a better understanding. 
For context:
- I live with his mom and sibling 
- the ‚Äúkids‚Äù are all adults in 20s  
- he was uneducated on politics and attempted to debate when I said I was voting for Kamala.. I told him he desperately needed to do his own research 
- his brother (the youngest and most closed-minded) immediately said he wasn‚Äôt voting because both candidates were shit‚Ä¶ mind you he 100% did not know a single thing about Kamala/Walz
-after my bf did his research he registered to vote and told me it would be for Kamala/walz
-Yesterday I put up a Harris/Walz sign in our front yard and he is demanding that I take it down because he doesn‚Äôt want people knowing information that he doesn‚Äôt voluntarily share (I.e. he‚Äôs a ‚Äúprivate person‚Äù

When I ask him why he says it‚Äôs because he doesn‚Äôt want other people to view him in that context. Question why not? You don‚Äôt want people to view you as having humane, morals, and competency? You should be proud that that sign is on your yard. 

His rebuttal was that he‚Äôs just a private person and that‚Äôs how he was raised and seeing as I literally live with his family, it would be three against one. I told him maybe it was time to think for himself and just because you were a certain way doesn‚Äôt mean that you can‚Äôt become your own person and he was like I‚Äôm not gonna change Circles I think he‚Äôs slower. This one is more significant than the others because this election matters. Especially for women. Roe v. Wade was overturned a few years ago and I asked him how he felt about it. He literally thought I was talking about a sports game and was like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know those teams.‚Äù 

Mind you I‚Äôve been on birth control for years that has fucked up my mental health for HIS pleasure. because Lord knows I‚Äôm not getting much out of it.

I know I‚Äôm kind of just ranting now, but I need help understanding his perspective. My point to him was that at the center of it he‚Äôs just caring what other people think of him. And he states that he doesn‚Äôt care what people think of him at all. But if he really didn‚Äôt care then why does it matter if there‚Äôs a sign in front of your house, showcasing that you are a competent human being??

1g7jnxy,Reality Check (not doom),https://i.redd.it/d96qjx02bsvd1.png,"I see many folks panicking about the race tightening, and I understand. I've got good news and bad news...

The only way this race WASN'T going to be tight was if Kamala ran a flawless Hall of Fame campaign. The default scales of this campaign are nearly even. Kamala being an Obama-like candidate that people *wanted* to vote for would have tipped the scales, and for a few months, she was. She killed it at the convention, the debate, etc.

But the past two weeks she's been way off her game. Saying she couldn't think of anything she would do differently from Biden on The View was a huge mistake. Her appearance on Colbert was stiff and over-rehearsed (which is her weak point and something she was able to manage so well early on). 
Walz has not been as advertised and they're both too happy-go-lucky at a time when many people aren't so happy with the state of things.
She recovered with the Fox News interview, but the shine is officially off. 

Yes it would have been great to have that cushion heading into the last few weeks (and I bet we would all sleep better) but we're passed that. We're back to a 50/50 fight. I still like our chances.

Ask yourself if you're doing all you can to help. Hang in there.

To combat this, I have been trying to present facts and links to reports. I am not trying to start a fight but I have gotten hateful Facebook messages from people I literally have not talked to in decades. 

I have shared on topics like food processing deregulation, world mental health day, climate change, domestic violence, Tr*mp tax cuts, migrants and crime statistics, misinformation vs. disinformation.

They were basically planning ways to throw the whole electoral process into chaos by:

	1.	Using objections from Republican lawmakers to challenge the results in key states and delay the certification of Biden‚Äôs win.
	2.	Pressuring Mike Pence to overstep his role and personally choose electors for Trump, even though Pence‚Äôs job was just to count the votes.
	3.	Creating so much procedural confusion and delay that it would force the election into a legal mess, potentially handing the win to Trump through technicalities.

Now here‚Äôs where we all need to take a moment and be grateful for Mike Pence‚Äôs sudden discovery of morals and principles. Who would‚Äôve thought we‚Äôd be thanking the guy for not going along with this plan?

At the end of the day, though, the safeguards of democracy held up.

1g6iukt,Talking Points - Missed Opportunities,https://i.redd.it/2f5slztnuivd1.jpeg,"While watching the Kamala Harris interview on Fox News, I found my wondering why the democrats haven‚Äôt formulated better talking points on key issues for voters.

For example, when Bret Baier asked Harris why the overwhelming majority of Americans believe Trump is stronger on the economy, she could  have used this as an opportunity to correct the Republican narrative/rhetoric.

Instead of dancing around the question and trying to highlight other issues with Trump, I believe there‚Äôs a strong fact-based approach that should, if properly executed, land well with voters.

Here‚Äôs how I would answer the question: 

‚Ä¢ Start by pointing out the obvious: (1) in 2020,  the entire world experienced a global pandemic, which hospitalized millions, caused numerous industries to come to halt, and shutdown major global supply chains, and (2) in 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, which, in addition to being a wholly unjust invasion of a foreign country, caused dramatic effects on the price of oil.

‚Ä¢ admit that it prices have increased and that you understand how hard that is for nearly all Americans.

‚Ä¢ point out that Trump was only President for the very beginning of Covid and certainly was not around when global economies started feeling the effects of the pandemic.

‚Ä¢ make it very well known that the ‚Äúbad economy‚Äù was not a uniquely American issue. Explain that virtually every major economy around the world experienced rising inflation (point to cold hard facts).

‚Ä¢ explain that inflation in the U.S. rose slower and cooled quicker than many major nations, especially compared to nations that conservatives seem to love (i.e., Hungary).

‚Ä¢ credit this to Biden, the Federal Reserve, and American ingenuity. 

‚Ä¢ Offer someone to blame. If this was a uniquely American issue then by all means blame democrats. But it wasn‚Äôt. It also wasn‚Äôt a progressive liberal issue, point to high inflation in conservative run countries. We had a bad economy because of factors outside of our control and we should be thankful that the Biden administration got us through quicker and with less pain than the vast majority of countries around the world.

‚Ä¢ finally, I would close with offering an answer to the underlying question about why Americans feel that Trump is better on the economy. It‚Äôs human nature to want to credit good times to our Presidents and in many cases you should. But the facts are different here, and it‚Äôs networks like this (Fox News) that are misleading Americans by acting like Biden is to blame for higher inflation. When in reality he should be thanked for preventing inflation from getting out of control.

This is my first election where there was a woman who was on the Democratic ticket for every position that was opposed. I did not vote for them *because* they are women, but because they were truly the candidate I supported. It just blew my mind that in Tennessee, I had the option to vote for another woman in every position, and that they were the ones who won the primary. A couple of them, the Republican opponent was also a woman. This astounded me since there is so much misogyny in Tennessee. I hope this is a sign of good things to come!

Well?! He IS bad. Some say the baddest. This election is largely to vote against him.

He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshipped, so that he sets himself up in God‚Äôs temple, proclaiming himself to be God.

Don‚Äôt you remember that when I was with you I used to tell you these things? And, now, you know what is holding him back, so that he may be revealed at the proper time. For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work; but, the one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way. And, then, the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming. The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with how Satan works. He will use all sorts of displays of power through signs and wonders that serve the lie.

1g5524z,From Lorraine Evanoff‚Äôs Substack today!,https://i.redd.it/61sj7iepl5vd1.jpeg,"Like a beat-up old jalopy, the right-wing outrage mobile keeps backfiring. Every time they step on the gas, it has the opposite intended effect, also known as the Streisand Effect. And it seems like the Harris-Walz campaign and Democrats are capitalizing on this phenomenon by using every right-wing distraction as a guide for their own messaging.

Examples of backfiring messages include: Fox News deceptively editing President Biden‚Äôs comment about threats of election day violence, which only focused attention on the January 6th insurrectionists; Jill Stein got her name on the ballot in Wisconsin, where Biden won in 2020, only to remind everyone that her 2016 third-party candidacy sabotaged Hillary Clinton‚Äôs election; Trump‚Äôs unhinged rally speeches have only magnified his fourth-grade speaking abilities, his racist obsession with genetics, and his lack of understanding how anything works.

And Democrats have been optimizing these distractions and bombshells. One shocking revelation from the new book by Bob Woodward that Trump shipped COVID testing equipment to Vladimir Putin, which Russia then corroborated, has been widely reported. Also, news that Trump and dozens of republicans were endorsed by a right-wing trophy hunting group that targets adorable pigmy hippos like the famous Moo Deng, has been making the rounds.

Democrats aren‚Äôt just boosting damaging bombshells. They are also highlighting the duds. The dockworkers strike that caused momentary panic about supply chain interruptions before the holidays ‚Äì which was supposed to be Trump‚Äôs October surprise ‚Äì ended after only two days, and made Biden look like a champion of unionized labor.

Democrats have also taken a creative approach to messaging. FEMA added a ‚ÄúHurricane Rumor Response‚Äù page to their website telling the truth about FEMA‚Äôs heroic handling of the hurricanes. And Kamala Harris spoke directly to the Weather Channel‚Äôs 1.17 million subscribers.

Let‚Äôs not forget law enforcement. The FBI thwarted a planned election-day terrorist attack, sending two resounding messages: The intelligence community is keeping voters safe; and anyone planning terrorist attacks is under surveillance and will be caught.

PLAYBOOK FOR EARLY RESPONSE TO HIGH-CONSEQUENCE EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND BIOLOGICAL INCIDENTS 

created by a top-level White House National Security Council team that was *specifically* put together to help Presidents and the government fight pandemics (because it's harder to think in a moment of emergency and because expertise and strategy are important when millions of lives are at stake)

https://www.statnews.com/2020/05/17/the-art-of-the-pandemic-how-donald-trump-walked-the-u-s-into-the-covid-19-era/

https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/trump-coronavirus-national-security-council-149285

Unlike other countries, *our* country can be proud that we used data and science and expertise and created an actual pandemic playbook for *exactly what to do step-by-step to respond to a potentially high-consequence emerging infectious disease.* 

*We* might have been able to avoid the worst of it.

And the Trump administration *disbanded* that team, calling it ""government bloat"" and got rid of some people, absorbed some of the others into jobs that ""at least still had things to do with pandemic response"". 

Trump *disbanded the team*, and then decided to *ignore* the playbook that had been created and just do whatever he wanted 

- which included downplaying the danger of the pandemic, acting to Americans like ""it'll be over soon"" and like he had it well in hand, discouraging thousands from getting vaccines or social distancing or wearing masks, and spreading disinformation claiming vaccines spreading autism, while he sent *our* covid tests and ventilators, plus a 5.6 milliion Coronavirus Aid Package, *to our enemy Russia*

https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/05/21/860143691/u-s-sends-ventilators-to-russia-in-5-6-million-coronavirus-aid-package

The pandemic wouldn't have gotten as bad as it had, it wouldn't have killed off more people in America than other countries, we wouldn't have had over 111,000 Americans die, 

we might have *avoided* the pandemic getting so bad in the US it tanked our economy, and led to the inflation and raised grocery prices that everyone complains about, 

had Trump not prioritized his ego over American lives.

So, if anyone wants to blame someone for the pandemic bringing our grocery prices so high, *blame the person whose actions led it.*

Having said that, here's some data:

Data: Despite the pandemic recession being deeper than that of the Great Recession, under Harris and Biden our economy recovered faster than it did during the Great Recession 

https://www.cbpp.org/research/economy/tracking-the-recovery-from-the-pandemic-recession

Data: Why gas prices rose (P.S. They're going down now)

https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2020/article/from-the-barrel-to-the-pump.htm

Data: Proof inflation went up globally (P.S. it's going down now)

https://www.cfr.org/tracker/global-inflation-tracker

Data: This data shows that Trump didn't create a strong economy, he inherited it from Obama. This includes job growth and unemployment. The Joint Economic Committee is the congressional committee responsible for reporting economic data for the US and for making suggestions on improving the economy. So they are THE authority on it.

https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/2c298bda-8aee-4923-84a3-95a54f7f6e6f/did-trump-create-or-inherit-the-strong-economy.pdf

Data: This data shows how the economy experienced a record rebound under Biden and Harris. This includes a rise in job growth, a rise in new business startups, a drop in unemployment, and more.

(The Joint Economic Committee is one of four standing joint committees of the US Congress. It was created as a part of the employment act of 1946, which deemed the committee responsible for reporting the current economic condition of the United States and for making suggestions to improve it. They are the authority on the economic state of the US.)

Data: This data shows the pattern of how the economy tends to improve under Democratic presidents and worsen under Republican ones. Biden and Harris continued the trend of Democratic presidents improving the economy. Again from the Joint Economic Committee.

Nobel Laureate economists and other top economists have said that Harris's policies would make the economy better and Trump's policies would make the economy worse. You should believe the experts.

Gas prices are now lowering. Companies are admitting to having taken advantage of the pandemic to price gouge customers. Companies including Walmart, Target, Aldi, IKEA, Amazon Fresh, Walgreens, CVS, Giant Food, Michaels, Best Buy, have recently announced that they were lowering prices and have started to do so. McDonald's, Burger King, and KFC now have $5 meal options.

1g3w87k,Trump‚Äôs Fascism needs to be brought up more often ,https://newrepublic.com/article/181258/american-fascism-look-like?cmdf=trump+fascism,"The 10 signs of fascism are often summarized based on the work of historian Dr. Lawrence Britt, who analyzed fascist regimes of the 20th century. The signs include:

	1.	Powerful and continuing nationalism ‚Äì National symbols, slogans, flags, and patriotic mottos are often prominently displayed, sometimes with an emphasis on national unity or exceptionalism.
	2.	Disdain for human rights ‚Äì The use of fear, torture, or denial of basic human rights to maintain control, often justifying this as necessary for security or prosperity.
	3.	Identification of enemies/scapegoats ‚Äì Targeting specific groups as enemies (often minorities, immigrants, or political opponents) to unify followers against a common threat.
	4.	Supremacy of the military ‚Äì Elevating the military to a special, exalted position and using military power as a central aspect of governance or society.
	5.	Rampant sexism ‚Äì Promoting traditional gender roles, patriarchy, and policies that undermine gender equality.
	6.	Controlled mass media ‚Äì Censorship or manipulation of the media, or attacking the media as ‚Äúthe enemy of the people,‚Äù to control the narrative.
	7.	Obsession with national security ‚Äì Prioritizing national security above all else, often to justify authoritarian measures and reducing civil liberties.
	8.	Religion and government intertwined ‚Äì Using religious language, symbols, or beliefs to justify government actions or to give the appearance of moral authority.
	9.	Corporate power protected ‚Äì Collaboration between government and large corporations, often at the expense of individual rights and small businesses.
	10.	Labor power suppressed ‚Äì Undermining unions and workers‚Äô rights in favor of corporate or government control.

Trump Administration & These Signs

Many critics have pointed out that the Trump administration displayed some concerning trends that echo elements of fascism. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how these signs align:

	1.	Nationalism ‚Äì Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù rhetoric, use of slogans like ‚ÄúMake America Great Again,‚Äù and his emphasis on national identity reflect a powerful focus on nationalism.
	2.	Disdain for human rights ‚Äì Policies like family separations at the U.S. border and restrictions on asylum-seekers have been viewed by many as human rights violations.
	3.	Identification of scapegoats ‚Äì Trump often targeted immigrants, the media, and political opponents (such as labeling certain groups or people as ‚Äúthe enemy of the people‚Äù).
	4.	Supremacy of the military ‚Äì While Trump showed strong support for the military and used it for political purposes (like in the protests), he didn‚Äôt entirely prioritize military control.
	5.	Rampant sexism ‚Äì His administration faced accusations of undermining women‚Äôs rights (especially with certain judicial appointments and remarks) and accusations of sexism.
	6.	Controlled mass media ‚Äì Trump frequently attacked the media, calling it ‚Äúfake news‚Äù or ‚Äúthe enemy of the people,‚Äù which is a tactic used to discredit any critical reporting.
	7.	Obsession with national security ‚Äì Immigration policies, the building of the border wall, and the Muslim travel ban were justified in terms of national security.
	8.	Religion and government intertwined ‚Äì Trump aligned with evangelical Christians, often using religious rhetoric to court support and justify policies.

1g3w3ea,Harris campaign sees its path to victory in Pennsylvania running through the suburbs,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/kamala-harris-sees-path-victory-pennsylvania-running-suburbs-rcna175307,"Vice President Kamala Harris‚Äô campaign laid out what it sees as her path to victory in Pennsylvania in a memo shared exclusively with NBC News ahead of Monday night‚Äôs rally in bellwether Erie County.

The Harris team pointed to polls showing Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, having made gains in the battleground state‚Äôs suburbs ‚Äî which it dubbed ‚Äúour own mini ‚Äòblue wall‚Äô‚Äù in Pennsylvania ‚Äî compared with President Joe Biden‚Äôs 2020 performance there.

The campaign also emphasized that a win involves boosting its popularity among educated suburbanites, including those who have voted for Republicans in recent elections. Nearly 160,000 voters in the state cast ballots for former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley in the GOP presidential primary this year ‚Äî with her numbers proving stronger among suburban voters ‚Äî even after she had already dropped out of the race against former President Donald Trump.

The campaign cited surveys last month from The Philadelphia Inquirer/The New York Times/Siena College and Marist College that both showed Harris up 6 percentage points over Trump in the suburbs ‚Äî a notable improvement from Trump‚Äôs 3-point victory over Biden among suburban Pennsylvanians in 2020, as exit polls showed. (The results in both of the surveys last month fell within their margins of error.)

The campaign highlighted events that Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, have held in red counties like Johnstown, Lancaster and Rochester. It also detailed investments made in red parts of the state to ‚Äúcut margins and stop Trump‚Äôs only hope of victory,‚Äù noting that 16 of its 50 statewide campaign offices are in counties Trump won by more than 10 points in 2020.

The campaign highlighted that as of Sunday it had knocked on more than 1 million doors across the state, including 250,000 over the weekend, since Harris replaced Biden atop the Democratic ticket. It also referred to its 50 offices and 450 on-the-ground staff members.",58,3,John3262005,democrats,2024-10-15 01:15:51+00:00,0.95,/r/democrats/comments/1g3w3ea/harris_campaign_sees_its_path_to_victory_in/,False

California Professional Firefighters President Brian Rice said that the state‚Äôs firefighters and residents couldn‚Äôt afford to elect a president who threatens to withhold wildfire aid because of the state‚Äôs political leanings.

Former President Donald Trump has said several times he would not give California federal funds for its damaging wildfires unless Gov. Gavin Newsom went his way on water politics, most recently at a rally in Southern California on Saturday.

Amid a national union identity crisis, California firefighters‚Äô endorsement could theoretically help sway undecided voters in swing states, especially Western states that look to California as a firefighting model.

1g3umf8,"Harris launches ‚Äòblue wall‚Äô blitz through Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin",https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4933156-harris-blue-wall-campaign/,"Vice President Harris is blitzing through the states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan this week, as polls tighten and Democratic nerves fray over the possibility they could again lose the ‚Äúblue wall‚Äù to former President Trump.

Harris in the next six days will spend three days in Michigan, two days in Pennsylvania and a day in Wisconsin with multiple stops on each visit.

Harris has hopes of building a second path to 270 electoral votes that would include victories in other swing states such as Georgia, North Carolina and Arizona. But she trails Trump in the RealClearPolitics average in those states, all of which have generally been won by GOP presidential candidates over the last few decades.

The blue wall blitz by Harris shows she does not want to make a mistake some said Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton made in 2016 by not spending enough time campaigning in the three states.

Harris is also showing a willingness to take more risks. It was announced Monday that she will sit down for an interview with Fox News‚Äôs Bret Baier on Wednesday.

1g3rqjk,Discussing Politics with my Spouse,https://imgur.com/csVsDXG,"TLDR: I have disengaged from politics and drifted left since 2015ish Republican primary how do I civilly discuss politics with my wife who leans heavily conservative.
Background and demo info I am 38-year-old male with a college degree, high earning, vet, having lived in a deep red rural area my entire life. Basically, a prototypical Republican voter and up until 2015 I would say a hardline conservative. But over the last 10 years and the embrace of Trumpism by his voters and the Republican party. Has blown my mind I have had the veil lifted and see this party‚Äôs tomfoolery for what it is. And from my point of view anyone who does not see that is not fit to lead or they are ignoring it to exploit the country for their personal gain.
During the 2015 era I decided to disengage from all politics, consuming all the negativity about the fate of the nation, world, etc. from what seemed like all news sources was affecting my mood. So, I stopped paying any attention to news any more than headline scrolling. In retrospect my that was doom and gloom from conservative news sources. For years the Republican party primaries seemed to get more and more negative and focused on mudslinging regardless of policy. But when Trump busted on to the scene it seemed like the whole party did this monumental shift to school yard name calling the opposition as the preferred campaign tactic in the Republican Primary. ¬†After he won the nomination, he used this same Tactic against Hilary to great effect, and this resonated with the voters. I thought that there was no way he would win and considered myself firmly then a never Trumper voting for Gray Johnson. I think knowing full well I lived in a deep red state and my vote would not matter in the end and justified myself. But having two daughters I know I could not in good faith vote for a man with Trumps character, thinking grab her in the ***** was ever okay to say. The next election I did not repeat the past mistakes and voted Biden and completely Blue the rest of the way down. I was open about how I voted only to my Wife who did not vote that election cycle and to my family when it is brought up I have largely critical of Trump character and his civility. But never really coming out and saying yea‚Ä¶ I did not vote for the man.
Here we are in the third Trump election cycle and my wife who has been recently more engaged in politics but (honestly shockingly so to me) she has been very conservative and Pro Trump. She is the one who encouraged me to stop overconsuming the news and live in the here, now, and what I can control. Due to living in rural America and knowing that my opinions on politics will not be well received I literally never discuss it with anyone and keep to myself when my in-laws or parents/siblings bring it up. I fact I probably do not know a single blue voter or if I do they are hiding it like me. But when pressed by my wife in early August on voting and whom I was voting for. I could not make up a white lie out of it to keep the peace and flatly said I would vote for Biden/Harris (Pre Biden leaving) now it‚Äôs a vote for Harris/Waltz.

My biggest reason for switching sides besides let‚Äôs call them Trumpanigans is the Democrats support of Education, Gun control and Social Safety nets. The bootstrap mentality needs to be left behind. Society is all in this together and should assist those in need. ¬†And expecting them to bootstrap their way up simply because ‚Äúeveryone else had to‚Äù is counter to my beliefs. I see plenty of posts on here about simply cutting off all trump supporters because they are stupid, evil, etc not to engage because they cannot be reasoned with. But that is not an option. So how do I articulate this to my spouse who believes that the democrats are liars and plain evil and likely has never heard the democratic POV at all?",134,35,Strykfirst,democrats,2024-10-14 21:47:23+00:00,0.95,/r/democrats/comments/1g3rqjk/discussing_politics_with_my_spouse/,False

1g2rf5p,Elon musk is literally an immigrant that sought asylum from the SA apartheid system,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/05/world/africa/elon-musk-south-africa.html,"It is wild to me that Elon Musk can be an immigrant who sought asylum from the apartheid as he felt distain and fear toward his government, yet is so pro-republican. He exuberantly supports Donald Trump and the Republican Party who spew nonsense about Mexicans and Haitians (et al), when most of these same people fear their government or are in danger and need to seek asylum. These people work and contribute to society to provide a net good. 

I agree that illegal immigrants and immigrants who commit major crimes should be deported, but they should also be able to make their case before they are booted.  I should note that I also think speaking English proficiently is a necessity after a certain amount of time for immigrants who sought asylum as well as immigrants who went through normal immigration bureaucracy shit.

It seems to me, the reason why the Republican Party and Republicans aren‚Äôt okay with a sustainable large scale legal immigration scheme, is because the immigrants aren‚Äôt white. God forbid people of colour are spotted more often or engaged with more often. 

But this would be such a strange revelation considering Elon Musks views on the apartheid, he clearly doesn‚Äôt think black persons have less moral value. He‚Äôs also said that if Kamala wins it will be the last election, which is wild considering trump is the guy who tried to coerce his VP into not certifying the result and inciting an insurrection.

Angela Stiens is on the national Democratic Party‚Äôs radar, as is the Kansas Legislature. Democrats need to gain just two seats in the 125-member House or three in the 40-member Senate to break a supermajority that has enabled Republicans to override Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly‚Äôs vetoes of measures restricting abortion providers and transgender rights.

A similar battle is playing out in North Carolina, where the flip of a single seat in either the House or Senate could cost Republicans a veto-proof majority that has repeatedly imposed its will over the objections of a Democratic governor. In Nevada, meanwhile, it‚Äôs Democrats who stand to gain a veto-proof majority over a Republican governor, if they can pick up just one more state Senate seat without losing one in the Assembly.

The Associated Press identified 14 states where a swing of just three or fewer seats could determine whether a party holds a supermajority, meaning a margin so dominant that a party is able to enact laws despite a governor‚Äôs veto, convene special sessions or place constitutional amendments on the ballot without needing any support from lawmakers of an opposing party.",10,2,John3262005,democrats,2024-10-13 07:48:16+00:00,0.83,/r/democrats/comments/1g2klbt/legislative_majorities_giving_one_party_all_the/,False

 First of all, I'm really into economics and Trump wants to implement tariffs, which will effect our entire supply chain and end up raising prices for consumers. Also last time he put tariffs on China they ended up raising tariffs on the USA. Which really effected the farmers leading to the government having to bail them out.


Second of all I'm really optimistic about lowering healthcare costs especially the costs of prescriptions. Personally I'm on a medication (that I won't disclose.) It costs $220/month with insurance and $100/month with goodrx. I understand there's R&D costs, but these things cost dollars to produce.


Third of all. Trump wants to give police more immunity. Which will just lead to more violations of our constitutional rights, specifically the 1st, 4th, 5th, 6th, and maybe even the 14th amendments. We need to abolish police unions and qualified immunity, not give them more immunity.


4th, he wants to have more control over ecomic policy and give the Federal open market comittee (FOMC) less power. The FOMC controls interest rates and is mostly politically independent.


There's also the fact that he's a hypocrit, who hates china but sells $100,000 Chinese watches. Also you know he is a felon, but anyways I think I'll be done ranting.

When Trump goes away one way or another the supporters will remain and find another tool to worship. A majority of them are Christian nationalists looking to ruin this country by making it a Christian Taliban Nation. They're not big into democracy they're not big into elections they're all about autocracy and corporatocracy.

How do we wake up the zombies who follow him so they stop following these tin pot dictators who want to run everything in this country like a king rather than a president? That's the bigger picture see the photo above replace it with Chairman Mao and it's just as relevant in the 60s as Trump doing the exact same thing today.

And the fact that his images on that board makes a lot of sense because there's nothing behind it nothing it's an image it's fake. But the easily manipulated in this country because of their lack of education and intelligence line up behind him. And when Trump goes away he will be replaced with another Avatar to be worshiped. Because make no mistake Trump is a puppet with a lot of hands controlling him.

What's the cult deprogramming plan we need to get these people to wake up with. They don't even realize how big of a danger they are to themselves and the nation. I'm just glad I won't live too much longer to have to deal with it but believe me it's going to come to a head.

1g1qjqe,Encouragement from Central Virginia.,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g1qjqe,"TLDR at the bottom

Today I decided to go for a drive to one of my favorite spots out towards the Shenandoah Valley. I've driven this route probably hundreds of times in my life by now. I was in a band for 10 years that took me out to this area every week. 

I live on the western edge of Spotsylvania County in an area close to what is considered Central Virginia. It's very rural in my area. Large estates, farms, and some very poor areas are scattered throughout this region. There is one road I refer to as ""shack lane"" were there are at least 5 or 6 very run down shack houses that have tarps on their roofs, broken down cars in the front yard, and of course.....Trump flags and signs. 

I've realized over the years that the same people put the same political signs out every election cycle. I've learned where all of the Trump supporters are and I can expect all of their signs to be out. There are some houses that have cut ""Pence"" out of their old signs and taped ""Vance"" in place. Some houses have hand made Trump signs and really vile political messages.

In 2016, this area I drove through was littered with Trump signs. It seemed like, at times, every house had one for miles. I remember I drove for over an hour and never saw one Clinton sign. Not one. That's what really made me nervous and we all know how 2016 went. 

In 2020, I went on the same drive about this time of year and saw slightly fewer Trump signs but still saw a lot. Most of the signs were from 2016 and we're just never removed except to cut grass around them. I remember this one house having a huge Biden sign and I was so surprised by it because the area is so rural, I had just assumed there wasn't going to be any support for Biden at all. But I did see several signs. Not many, but they were there. 

So....2024 is here and I made my drive again this year. I hadn't been out this way since early summer this year and no one had really started putting signs out then and Harris had yet to be handed the reins. 

Literally 30 mins into my drive, I was absolutely floored by the amount of Harris/Walz signs. One house even had a Harris sign and right beside it a sign beside it for the Republican Senate candidate. My mouth dropped open seeing that. To me that means Republicans in my area ARE voting for Harris more so than I expected. 

I turned on to shack lane and all of those old run down houses......except one.....had no Trump flags or signs. It was very very strange. I actually circled around and drove by again and didn't see anything. There was one house that always had a Trump flag and Confederate flag on a flag pole together. Both flags were gone and just an POW and American flag was in their place.

On my way back home, I drove the same route to check some of these houses again for their staunch Trump support, and just didn't see nearly as many Trump signs as I expected. What I did see was dozens of Harris/Walz signs as well as a F@#$ Trump flag hanging in a tree so you'd see it as soon as you turn on to one road.....which is where ""shack lane"" is. 

Now, I don't like to make assumptions or anything, but this is NOT normal for this area. Not at all. Virginia was always expected to go blue. That's not the point of this post. The point is really to say that the support for Harris is much much larger than I anticipated and that was shocking. I have felt, for a while, like she'd likely win. But now I am much more encouraged by the amount of support I've seen. 

TLDR;

Saw a lot of Harris signs in unexpected places and far fewer Trump signs than expected in rural Virginia. This has really been spot on with the past two elections. It's very very encouraging.

1g1q7uv,Obama should call Trump,https://i.redd.it/6q56j995j8ud1.jpeg,"Here is my incredibly bad take. I think that Barack Obama should be calling Donald Trump. Donald Trump is a crazy dementia patient, and has always been obsessed with Barack Obama. I think this gives Obama an incredible leverage that he has not yet exercised. I think Obama could directly influence Donald Trump into completely losing his shit and fuck with him beyond all recognition. I think he‚Äôd think better of that, Obama would. But he should do it anyways. My ideal fantasy is a drone swarm, Mega Mind Style, off the coast of Florida outside Mar-A-Lago, in the shape of Obama‚Äôs floating head, calling on Donald while he is on the phone. We already know that Donald shits his pants. This would be a good set up for some fine pants-shitting action. I don‚Äôt think Obama is that petty though.

She added, ‚Äúpart of what I intend to do ‚Ä¶ is creating a bipartisan council of advisers who can then give feedback on policy as we go forward.‚Äù

During her campaign remarks in Scottsdale, in front of a banner that read ‚ÄúCountry Over Party,‚Äù she added that she doesn‚Äôt want ‚Äúyes people‚Äù around her.

She previously has said she would appoint a Republican to a future Cabinet, which she repeated on ‚ÄúThe View‚Äù this week as an example of something she would do differently than President Biden.

In another direct appeal to Republican and independent Arizonans, Harris said, ‚ÄúI am committed to all of you to be a president for all Americans ‚Ä¶ knowing we have so much more in common than what separates us.‚Äù

Harris‚Äôs campaign has worked to appeal to Republican and independent voters in the critical swing states, including Arizona, and have received several endorsements from Republicans, including former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Rep.

The DNC will roll out the ad campaign, worth at least $100,000, on Friday morning in 16 publications across eight states, and it is estimated to reach more than 1 million voters in the first week. Those publications include the Washington Blade and Metro Weekly in the Washington, D.C., area; Out South Florida; Qnotes in Charlotte, North Carolina; the Las Vegas Spectrum; Georgia Voice; GoGuide Voter‚Äôs Guide in Iowa; Dallas Voice; Philadelphia Gay News; Ambush Magazine in New Orleans; ION Arizona; and SWERV Magazine, a national Black LGBTQ periodical.

The campaign will be featured in the Georgia Voice during Atlanta‚Äôs Pride weekend and in Philadelphia Gay News during OurFest, a festival to celebrate National Coming Out Day in Pennsylvania.

The ads feature the message ‚ÄúFreedom is on the Ballot. Make a Plan to Vote,‚Äù and they urge voters to visit Iwillvote.com, a DNC-run platform that helps eligible voters register and check their registration status, check the status of cast ballots and learn more about voting. The ads use a simple red, white and blue  scheme, and some feature the progress Pride flag, which also includes the transgender flag colors and colors to represent LGBTQ communities of color.

The DNC worked on the ads with Rivendell, the oldest LGBTQ marketing and media company in the country. 

The ads will roll out just a day after the Harris-Walz campaign and the Human Rights Campaign, the nation‚Äôs largest LGBTQ advocacy group, launched 10 Days of Action, a series of events aimed at mobilizing LGBTQ and allied voters.

1g0z7ob,Walz to launch media blitz to woo male voters,https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/10/tim-walz-media-blitz-00183360,"Kamala Harris is dispatching Tim Walz to turn out male voters.

Faced with a serious polling deficit among young men, Harris‚Äô campaign is sending the Minnesota governor on a man-focused media blitz on Friday, including football-focused TV interviews and pheasant hunting with digital influencers, according to details shared first with POLITICO.

It‚Äôll start with a one-on-one interview with ABC Good Morning America‚Äôs Michael Strahan, a former NFL football player, at the University of Minnesota‚Äôs football stadium, airing on Friday morning. In the sitdown, the pair will discuss how Walz‚Äôs coaching career prepared him for politics and will feature some of his former students. Walz will also appear in a round of local TV interviews in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin ‚Äî which the campaign hopes will center on high school football and hunting. In Michigan, later on Friday, Walz will headline a voter engagement event with Black men.

Then, the governor will return to Minnesota, where he‚Äôll deliver the pep talk to Mankato West‚Äôs football team, his former football squad, ahead of their game against rivals Mankato East. And on Saturday morning, Walz will take a group of social media influencers, including veterans advocate David Boomer and a Black rodeo star Ramontay McConnell, pheasant hunting in Sleepy Eye, Minnesota.

Walz‚Äôs folksy relatability on TV ‚Äî famously tagging Republicans as ‚Äúweird‚Äù ‚Äî played a central role in elevating him to Harris‚Äô running mate this summer. But since he joined the ticket, he‚Äôs appeared less frequently on the cable news circuit, drawing criticism from fellow Democrats for the campaign being too cautious.

That‚Äôs changed this week, as the Harris team ramped up its media appearances for both Harris and Walz. In the last few days, Walz appeared on Fox News‚Äô Sunday show, sat down with ABC‚Äôs Jimmy Kimmel and appeared with Harris for a 60 Minutes interview.",46,3,John3262005,democrats,2024-10-11 02:04:07+00:00,0.95,/r/democrats/comments/1g0z7ob/walz_to_launch_media_blitz_to_woo_male_voters/,False
